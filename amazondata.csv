"B00NWE9RPA","Asus ROG G751JY 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7 4860H, 4 GB DDR3, 1TB HDD 7200 SSD With 256 GB RPM)","5","2015-05-05","it looks like maybe someone opened it up","I have read a lot of reviews on this laptop before buying it and everything I read was positive and I agree.<br /><br />I got this laptop used from the Amazon Warehouse which was about $500 cheaper than brand new and when I received this laptop, it looks like maybe someone opened it up, looked at it, maybe turned it on and then packed it back up and sent it back. There was no wear on it what so ever. There was only a small dent on the box that it came in and that's about it.<br /><br />The performace of this machine is awesome. It plays everything I throw at it at Max settings. But the best part I love about it is how quite it is when gaming or doing anything cpu/GPU intensive. I have played games on other gaming laptops and non of them come close to how quite this laptop is. Its just amazing.<br /><br />I have used it for about a month now and have not see anything wrong or bad about this laptop.<br /><br />There were a few times that I was gaming and have forgot to plug in the laptop and received a battery message about 2 hours afterwards, and to be honest, I have not noticed any performace issues while it was running on the batter (although I don't remember what game I was playing).<br /><br />I also use this laptop for class (my virtualization class) and have it run 4-5 VM's at the same time and it handles it quite well. I might get another 8GB memory stick so it will have 32GB but for now 24GB of memory is plenty.","2"

The specs speak for themselves. I bought this laptop because I’m a college student that goes home on the weekend. I travel from my dorm to my home every Friday and return back to campus every Monday. I am a hardcore gamer, and I wanted to be able to play all of my games on high settings. This laptop allowed me to play all of my games on high with 60 fps, and next gen games will also run on this beast at medium to high settings. I am also able to take the laptop with me on my trips home and to study groups.<br />Cons<br />I do not like the material that the laptop is made of. It is very susceptible to finger prints and anything else that’s greasy. I wrapped mine in carbon fiber vinyl which solved the problem. I hate that there are no official skins available for it.","4"

I think I've had it for a month now. I'm not really much of a gamer. I have been using it with Occulus Rift DK II. It's more for work than anything else. It was strange when it arrived, never had a computer come loaded with nothing, no junk, no anything, virgin operating system. There wasn't even an install disk for drivers, I had to go out to ASUS and grab them, along with the most recent NVIDIA ones. It's more laptop than I need, but I believe it will last me for a long time. Having had several high end laptops for programming, occasional games, and other things like video editing. This doesn't have an issue powering through anything, and the best thing about it when it does, I doesn't turn into a scalding radiator on your lap, barely seems to get warm.<br /><br />Pros: everything above<br /><br />Cons: it's disconcerting to go out and locate all of the drivers and things to optimize stuff. I am not even sure that's a bad thing.<br /><br />Overall: A beast. Absolutely nothing installed, no 30 day trial software I have to uninstall, no manufacturer garbage software. No wasting time just wiping it to install Pro or Enterprise Windows, which I usually do to save time removing all the junk. It's a &#34;power on and go&#34; machine just as it comes.","1"

I already love it. I play a variety of games, some being Minecraft, The Forest, Battlefield Hardline, and some other games. My first game I tested was Minecraft. I decided to try out a smaller server first to test how smooth it ran. It had absolutely no lag. I was shocked because just about every other gaming laptop I've tried has given me lag for Minecraft. Then I tested a very large server and ran without any lag again! After that I decided to try out a game called &#34;The Forest&#34; in the steam store, now my last laptop I had to run on the lowest settings and it still lagged enough to where I could hardly play. I was able to run this game on the highest settings and again, had NO lag.<br /><br />I'm waiting on Battlefield Hardline to finish downloading and installing now, I'll add on to my review after I test that out!","1"

"B00WJSQRNK","Acer Aspire V15 Nitro Black Edition VN7-591G-70RT 15.6-Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) Gaming Laptop","1","2015-05-30","At least it looks pretty.","Awesome on paper, in reality... not so much.<br /><br />The build quality was decent, the left side of the screen on the unit I received was loose.  The glue must have come undone somehow.  The right hinge that attached the display to the body was uneven and made a popping noise every time the laptop was opened.  I'm very disappointed in how cheap the overall laptop felt.<br /><br />The other issue and the reason i RETURNED it, was the WiFi.  The older model used a 802.11 a/b/g/n chip, which many people complained about having terrible reception and bad range.  This newer model was SUPPOSED to have 802.11/a, which it doesn't.  I was having constant connection problems anywhere from 75ft+ from my router.  It's not my internet, as I tested my work laptop (Lenovo Y50) and had no problems with it.  I'm frustrated because it clearly stated in the item description that it used the newer WiFi band.<br /><br />It handled gaming like a champ, the keyboard felt good, and the track pad wasn't too terrible.  Maybe if they can fix some of these problems, I'd reconsider buying another, but until then, I'd stay away.  For $1,000+ you expect more.","11"

To be more specific I ordered the ASUS ROG i7, GTX 960M graphics card, 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD. I did a good deal of research prior to purchasing from Amazon, but saved about $100 in doing so compared to Newegg.com or TigerDirect.com. I'd like to add that after reading a large amount of the bad reviews on this notebook, I determined that those users likely had bad experiences due to lack of research on their behalf. If you are not computer literate or confident, please consult one of your nerd friends to help you make an educated decision. In the time I have had this notebook I have thrown intense online gaming at it on max settings as well as audio recording and it has performed flawlessly. After removing the bloatware that came with the computer I have been absolutely happy with this computer and would recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful notebook under $2000.","1"
"B00RV7Z1Q8","MSI GS60 GHOST-265 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop","3","2015-06-05","Subpar components, Loud fan!","=====ORIGINAL REVIEW=========== Ordered This laptop through 2 day shipping and was pretty excited to spend the weekend gaming with it. It arrived right on time, BUT with a dead Hard Drive/SSD. It won't boot past the MSI logo and keeps entering the BIOS after doing a &#34;Media Check&#34; and says &#34;No Media found....&#34;, which means the BIOS isn't able to recognize the Primary partition on the mSATA SSD. The &#34;F3&#34; recovery key (as stated in the user manual) didn't work as well. This is literally right out of the box after UPS delivered it at my doorstep, so it's not even a day old. I also tried re-installing a copy of Windows 8 that I have using an UEFI bootable memory stick but the installation processe halted while formating the primary partition (SSD) with a memory error, which meant the mSATA was dead. I also do not think that the mSATA died in-transit, since SSDs are more tolerant to shock because of the absence of physical disks, so it had to be dead while in assembly line. Amazon is shipping me a replacement, but I am going to give it a test run anyways and return it for a refund and go for an Asus or Lenovo Y50.  It's a shame because the laptop looks absolutely gorgeous and is by far the thinnest gaming laptop I have ever seen and is super light, and honestly that is the only reason I took chances with MSI because I was highly skeptical of the quality of the product and my fears are actually true. MSI has poor quality control and seems that they use SUBPAR components. SSD seems to be a kingston SSD and I believe that is dead, since the computer won't boot at all. Who puts a &#34;Kingston SSD&#34; on a $1600 laptop?? Highly unreliable. And oh! the fan noise is close to my vacuum cleaner, even in BIOS mode the fans were going nuts and it was pretty loud, it also got a little hot. It was just in BIOS mode all the time and it got hot with fans whirling loudly I can't imagine what it would do when it actually boot into windows let alone while playinga game. It was my fault to not take the SSD failure reviews from other websites seriously. But a lesson has been learnt.  =============UPDATE=================== I received the replaced unit from amazon and thankfully this time all is well so I am bumping up the rating to 3 stars. Here are some pros and cons-  PROS- 1. Extremely Light and slim profile. Let me repeat, for a 15.5&#34; laptop, this is really really light weight. 2. Very pretty Display. It's not an IPS display (i think) but it does a pretty good job. No color bleeding noticed so far. I just wish the bezels weren't as thick and due to compactness and size it wobbles and has considerable flex due to the two hinges so you ought to be careful with it. 3. Steel series RGB keyboard customizability. Nice feature, but I would barely use it, but it's a nice to have feature for gamers. 4. Very fast boot and shut down times. The 16 gigs of memory and SSD does a pretty good job of keeping up with the OS level tasks. However, we will need to see how the SSD garbage collection fairs out in the long run. 5. Key board is very nice and tactile. The keys have a very nice travel and looks good too, other than the weird fonts used on the keyboard not a big fan of it. 6. Plenty of ports - 3 USB 3.0 with 1 power USB, SD card reader, HDMI, Ethernet Cable, Mini Display etc. and they are all appropriately positioned on both sides of the laptop. 7. Nice and long wall charger cables and the cables are flexible enough, the power brick is a bit too large but atleast it's slim.  CONS- 1. Fans are extremely loud. They would start whirling violently for no apparent reason even if you are not gaming and just copying files browsing etc. 2. Steel series RGB software is not friendly and needs some work. Also, the keyboard won't set to white light totally since there is some color bleeding from the bottom keys (spacebar, control, fn, alt) area which bleeds a mix of green/blue light when totally on white. Also the white is not totally whitebut I am ok with it however the blue/green bleed looks weird and distracting. 3. Killer wifi could be a little better. I updated all the drivers but still got an average of 3 to 5 Mbps lower speed than rest of the devices in my home and I have a 20Mbps connection. Perhaps this could be solved with a driver update in the future (?) 4. Did I mention that &#34;THE FANS ARE LOUD!!&#34; yes :( it is loud, very loud, but I think that is because of a slim profile of the laptop. 5. Battery is pretty bad, without gaming, with just some light downloading, productivity, or surfing the laptop lasts about 2 hours tops or sometime worse at 1.5 hrs. Again, I think the sacrifice in the battery size is because of the thinness of the laptop and it has a really tiny batter compared to the size of the laptop. I just wish if the battery backup would be better. PS: I have tested it with both Green and Normal Experience Shift Modes. 6. Tons of worthless bloatware including an annoying copy of Norton antivirus and other tools. But I guess you can get rid of them easily. 7. Track pad is terrible. I mean I have seen some bad ones in the past one but this one easily tops the list. I have read reviews about the trackpad online but since most of the reviews are I assumed some of those were exaggerations, but I was dead wrong. It has a weird texture and has a weird sensitivity. The &#34;Elan Smart-pad&#34; software barely works and multitouch is a nightmare,and palm rejection is almost non existent. Trackpad placement is odd but this is not the first laptop I am using with such a placement, so I will give that a pass. Just use a USB or bluetooth mouse with this anyways. And, windows key could get some getting used to since it has been moved to the right side and the &#34;Delete&#34; button is weirdly located above the num pad. 8. Sound, is not that great and sounds tinny at times. So I am not sure if that &#34;Dynaudio&#34; branding adds any benefits.","1"

Only the fans are a little noisy. As someone mentioned, the warranty sticker is tampered because seller upgraded the ram from 8gb to 16gb. This actually disappointed me at first. However, after did some research, I find it's not a problem in US. Check out this link from MSI official website: https://service.msicomputer.com/msi_user/support/techfaqdetail.aspx?formid=3070 . I also called MSI and they confirmed that the warranty wont be voided if users only upgrade the ram or hard drive / SSD. They also mentioned Canada is also included in this policy but I didn't find any info online. So finally it's not a problem to me and this is really a good deal to get this slim game laptop compared to those heavy ones like Alienware or ROG.","3"

The included Nvidia GeForce Experience includes a game optimization center which is very helpful for getting the most out of games without fiddling with the individual settings in-game. Turbofan button is also very nice and I'm surprised I don't see it on more laptops (it is loud but if that bothers you don't use it, duh)  The disk drive does feel VERY flimsy, but I download most of my games anyway.

I thought maybe something was wrong with my charge port since I believed the charger was in good condition. But soon I would learn this is not the case.  On a hunch, I tried my mother's charger (she has an acer laptop as well) and it worked perfectly. When I started to compare my charger to hers,  I realized that my charger looked like a knock off.  First off, every laptop I've owned, and every laptop I've seen, the little box attached to the charger has a little light that indicates whether or not the cord has power. My charger has no such light. And now it's stopped working completely.  Whoever manufactured it, does not manufacture for Acer.  So now I'm left with a knock off charger that doesn't work, I'm sharing a charger with my mom, and will have to pay 60-80 for a new charger. Not happy at all.","0"

"B00T7EXKLG","ASUS G751JL 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","5","2015-07-04","Exceeded my expectations on every level. DO IT!!","I haven't written a review on anything in years, but I've been so happy with this purchase that I was compelled to. As with anything this isn't a *perfect* product, but I haven't found anything to complain about yet either. The qualities I sought out were speed, build quality, low noise, good cooling system, and of course, low(ish) cost. Going into this purchase I did a lot of research; ended up with this specific model and I like to think I made the right choice.<br /><br />Over the last couple of weeks I've really been stressing this thing, gaming a lot, traveling with it, etc. and every expectation has been met...exceeded in most cases. For a gaming laptop it excels in EVERY desired attribute. The only thing that may not prove to be as future proof as the rest of it's specs is the GPU. At the time of this writing, the 965M GPU can run current games maxed out with no problem. Check out the screen shot for a sampling of games I currently have installed. Granted, not all of these games are hardware intensive, but most of them are, and I can run them all perfectly with the graphics settings set very high (most of them maxed). Certain features like DirectX 11 Tessellation in Batman Arkham City had to be turned off, for example, but once I disabled it there were no more frame rate drops (and personally, I can't tell a difference in graphics quality with it disabled). With time (a couple of years, give or take) I've sure there will be games that will bring it to it's knees, but for the time being, you're golden. You could buy a &#34;better&#34; ASUS ROG laptop with a higher end GPU but you'll be spending hundreds more, maybe even a grand more if you want the absolute current &#34;best&#34;. I just couldn't justify the price, especially since this laptop is so powerful in it's own right. With the money I saved by not purchasing the next model up I bought a bunch of games.<br /><br />To conclude, if your budget is in the 1,000 to 1,500 range, this is the laptop for you. It's bulky and heavy, yes, but I see that as a good thing. The build quality is rock solid, performance (thus far) is waaay beyond expectations, not to mention the screen just rocks! I could go on and on...do yourself a favor and pull the trigger.yes, but I see that as a good thing.

Ram/hard drive not accessible for easy upgrading. * it isn't as thin as the pictures look. It's still under an inch but the pics make it look like an ultra book * the deck shows fingerprints * no indicator lights for the caps lock or num lock keys  Suggestions for future revisions: * DVD drive could probably be separated to make it thinner. People usually use USB drives anyway if they need access to DVDs. * take a page out of dells handbook and decrease the bezel size to either make this a 17&#34; laptop with an 18&#34; screen, or have a 17&#34; screen in 15.6&#34; laptop footprint.  Don't cramp the keyboard though. It's perfect right now. * unlike the ssd software that Samsung and crucial provide with their ssds, there was no software included with this laptop for the Toshiba m.2 ssd.  Would be nice to have something to check on the ssd's health and adjust settings.  Other thoughts: Unlike other laptops I've bought, I feel no buyers remorse with this. Great value, great product.  If my desktop system wasn't a great gaming system, I could use this as my main machine.","14"

In a panic, I requested a new unit from Amazon.<br /><br />Six hours later, the laptop unfroze (I still have NO IDEA how I fixed it), and I went to cancel the replacement unit to find that Amazon had ALREADY shipped it!! Wow, now THAT'S great service!! Not to mention, I got the first one the day after I ordered it o.0<br /><br />I still have the first laptop, and it has been running like a champ for the last 6 months. It is a completely viable desktop replacement, I've been using it as such for the entire time. Driving my LG34UM95 at full 3440 X 1440 21:9 ultra-wide beautifully. It only gets about half the FPS that my desktop did, but I spent $5000 building that :p Well, including monitor and preipherals......<br /><br />Oh, and the Wi-Fi adapter IS fast! I just upgraded to 150MB/s service from my provider, and Speedtest recorded 165 MB/s even using the 802.11 AC wireless connection. I imagine using a wired connection would bump that up a little, but that's more than respectable.<br /><br />The finish on the top of the lid, while it feels nice, is a fingerprint magnet. Frankly, I haven't even bothered trying to keep it spotless after seeing other reviews.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase :)","6"

This laptop was a beast at first, but one debilitating problem kept making me furious. After waking it from a sleep, the screen develops a high speed flicker. It's nauseating to look at for any length of time. Powering the machine off completely and leaving it for a while, then powering back on seems to fix it. Users on youtube mention changing the screen brightness or resolution to get the flicker to go away, but that didn't work for me. Rebooting into the BIOS after the problem occurs does not make the flicker go away... it stays even though no drivers are loaded. I've tried removing all graphics drivers and then installing the latest and greatest Intel HD and nVidia drivers, even tries beta drivers and older drivers. Nothing works to fix this problem. Amazon, with their legendary customer service, sent me another so I could copy my data off and wouldn't be without a machine while ASUS wanted me to send in the laptop for warranty repair with no fast replacement. The replacement I received from Amazon did the same thing. Amazon rocks. This laptop and manufacturer do not.","4"

Started off working okay, but had it for only about 2 days.  When I got it I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10.  After the update, I kept getting the error message from the graphics program saying, &#34;Must be an MSI product to use this program.&#34;  So my laptop no longer recognized my product as an MSI product.  I then called MSI.  They asked me to read off the serial number.  When I got to the letters BUSK the MSI representative stopped me and asked, &#34;Where did you purchase your laptop?&#34;  I told him, &#34;Amazon.&#34;  He then said informed me that this is not their product because they don't have products with BUSK in the serial number.  He said that products do that have those letters in the serial number do not come with an operating system at all.  He said that some other company put the laptop together and that I will have to contact the seller.  I sent the seller an email, but didn't wait around for a response.  I put the driver disk that came with the laptop in, hoping that the graphics program will be recovered.  That crashed the laptop completely and it does not come up at all.  I then tried the Windows 8 disc that also came with the laptop and nothing happens.  Am now sending it back for a refund.  Luckily, Amazon has good customer service and is honoring my refund.  I did not have the system long enough to give a good assessment of how it works otherwise.  It did freeze on me one time when it was working, but I was downloading a Windows update, and that is what made it freeze, I'm sure it had nothing to do with the laptop.  Some things I learned that might be helpful to know: Be sure to install all of Windows 8 updates before trying to install Windows 10.  Windows 10 update will not work otherwise.  And finally, if you do install Windows 10 and get the graphics error, it might be best to just leave it as is because I am not sure how that really affected the laptop.  It seemed to be working fine despite the error message.  Of course, I didn't try any games though.  Update:  I commented below.  That was my update #2.  Update#3:  I ended up returning it.  Just before I did I realized that I was no longer getting the graphics error because the system's reboot and install feature deleted several applications and programs that came with my laptop when I first got it.  It deleted the graphics program, hence no more error messages.  I did run a racing game on it without that program, which performed well.  But after realizing that I lost several programs I was convinced that I wanted to return it.  The seller contacted me and offered a link to the Windows 10 version of the graphics program to see if that works.  I never tried it, and again, that was not the only program that got wiped out.","0"

I really want to like this computer, but it's been unreliable thus far.","I'll post an updated review eventually.<br /><br />A little background: I know what I'm doing. There are some other comments on here of people who clearly do not know what they are doing. I am not among those.<br /><br />That being said, I really WANT to like this computer - and it isn't far off.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Incredibly fast GPU, CPU, RAM, I haven't had any issues with those.<br />Lit keyboard and touchpad very attractive... when functioning correctly. Color changing interface easy to use... again, when functioning correctly.<br />Non-glossy screen looks very nice, accurate colors, low glare.<br />Battery lasts much longer than expected. (~5 hours)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Killer 1525 wifi has proven to be VERY unstable. Sometimes I get good speeds, sometimes not so much, sometimes I can't get internet with it at all. I downloaded new drivers to no avail - I just deleted the entire Killer software suite and drivers and reinstalled the entire thing. It APPEARS to be working. We'll see if that lasts. I had Intel wifi hardware on my last laptop and NEVER had these issues.<br /><br />Keyboard lights don't always work. The macro buttons on the left side of my keyboard sometimes decide to randomly change to a color which doesn't match my scheme... When I try to change them back, they insist they already are the color I'm trying to change them to (blue) when they are instead orange.<br /><br />I had to take off the back paneling and reattach the hard drive... upon boot, my computer was telling me &#34;No bootable devices found.&#34; Upon diagnostics, it found no hard drive installed. I'm not sure if it was just loose or what, regardless, on a laptop that is less than a week old, that is not a good sign. I'll update this in a few weeks with whether the issue has continued or not.<br /><br />I didn't even think to look - I hadn't ever owned a laptop without an optical drive before other than my school-issued macbook air... so I didn't know that was a &#34;thing,&#34; but this laptop does not have an optical (CD/DVD) drive. It certainly has the space to have one... but it does not.<br /><br />Summary: It's a very attractive computer with very good hardware. All USB ports are 3.0, the Nvidia 965 is very fast, and there is always the option of adding the alienware graphics booster. The keyboard lights are a nice touch... when they work correctly. The Killer wifi software shows promise - but I need it to be more reliable. I'll update this as to whether my latest fix continues working or not. The hard drive is working... for now. My intitial impression after 6 days is that this computer was not put together well... the materials feel nice, but a loosely attached hard drive and bad wifi drivers is not a good start. For now, I'll give it 3 stars. It's a good computer overall, but it hasn't been working nearly as smoothly as the HP laptops I have owned in the past. I'll update this in a few weeks as to whether it smooths out or not.","7"

I have an Alienware Mx17 R2 and this is thing is a little bit wider than it. My labtop is 17 inches and it tends to get hot when I do some serious gaming. So i bought this to keep things cool and boy does it do that. With the dual fans keeping thing cools, she doesn't heat up as fast. It still gets warm, but it doesn't over heat. The only down side I have about this is that I recommend that your computer surface be solid. What I mean by that is when you turn on the fans they tend to make a droning noise if the computer is not place just right on it and if the surface is not sturdy enough the it tends to make the droning noise a bit louder because the surface is not solid. I have a Desk at home and it does this to me all the time. It also depends on the speed of the fans. if the speed is low then the droning noise is not there, if it high its not there, but if you have it at medium then you may or may not encounter it, depending on the computers position. I would recommend this to anyone who has a serious gaming labtop.","0"
"B00RVUMRKS","MSI GE62 APACHE-002 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop","5","2015-08-10","Overall a very good gaming laptop and laptop in general","I bought this laptop about a week ago, and it still runs very well. After researching other gaming laptops and reading reviews about how they would show the Blue Screen of Death after a week, I started looking at this laptop and MSI laptops in general. They showed up with good ratings and reviews. When I got the laptop, it was quick to configure and it ran smoothly. On graphic intensive games it runs a solid 50-65 fps, on high settings. Any interaction with massive amounts of players runs 35-55 fps, on highest settings still, sometimes but rarely 60 fps. If you lower the settings to medium to medium-high it can get 60 fps with a massive amount of players in-game.<br /><br />The laptop itself is pretty neat too. The backlit keyboard is a cool feature, especially because it can be customized to any color you choose. The &#34;Max Fan&#34; option is a good feature as well, allowing you to cool the laptop down if it gets hot. The laptop gets a little warm when running games, but it's nothing to complain about.<br /><br />The only two downsides to this laptop is the battery and the sound. The laptop getting warm is only a minor downside. The battery, running on &#34;Gaming&#34; battery setting, or &#34;High Performance&#34; battery setting while on the battery gives about an hour and 10 mins when fully charged. But if you are gaming, you would probably have the laptop plugged in anyway. The sound, I have to say for this laptop, is slightly bad, only when coming out of its internal speakers. I think it was a bad placement to put them on the bottom and the back of the laptop. You have to turn your sound up very high in order to just hear anything, and the quality isn't so great. But if you plug in headphones/earbuds/speakers the sound is great. There is a profile selector for HD sound quality. It has &#34;Movie&#34;, &#34;Music&#34;, and &#34;Game&#34; settings for best sound quality.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this laptop for gaming or anything in general, mediumto very high settings for games. I have never once had to lower any setting down past medium for any game. It is quick on the internet with fast loading speeds. The keyboard has a nice comfortable feel to it and the buttons push down smoothly. The laptop runs smoothly and the boot up time is quick.","0"

The FEEL of the keyboard The build quality of the machine Graphics amplifier 2 M.2 SSD slots GTX 965M is a great card for the average gamer.  Almost as fast as a GTX 780M  Cons: Heat.  HEAT HEAT.  I mean HOT.  Keyboard becomes uncomfortable on mine.  I would imagine it is crappy thermal paste as most manufactures can't apply thermal paste right. The trackpad is horrible.  I mean really bad.  To the point that I think that I may have a faulty unit.  Skips, won't scroll, etc. The placement of the keyboard.  It is weird.  Your placement is about a key to the right of what it would be on any other laptop.  It is very weird. The palm rest is so much smaller than the old 17 & 18, and your wrists are very near the edge and if you are not careful will dig in. The biggest issue that I have the is the amount of light bleed on the system.  This and the trackpad is why I am hitting this machine so hard.  The light bleed is the worse that I have ever seen on any system in my life.  It is so bad that if you have a black background it looks like an old B&W TFT screen from the 90's.  It is horrible.  Debating on returning the system.  I will be calling Dell to have them replace the screen on a one day old laptop.","9"

Aftermarket cooling doubled my FPS","Awesome machine, would be nice if they would include an option to upgrade to the 980 since its more of a compatible 4k gpu. Nonetheless this is still an amazing machine with as much power as you can reasonably ask for out of a laptop. Many people are looking to buy these as desktop replacents and are getting completely blindsided by the overheating issues that plauge thin high performance laptops. I was a victim of this firsthand, its shocking when you fireup your game and within 30 minutes of playing your laptop is hot enough to easily fry an egg. This is not the thinnest laptop ever but it still suffers from all the same issues. I nearly returned my laptop but after many hours of researching aftermarket laptop cooling and multiple purchases I am completely satisfied and can play for hours on end (unlimited) without ever feeling like I'm putting my machine in harm way. To make a long story short I ended up ordering 2x Opolar nc05 laptop usb fans (must have) and a cooling pad ( cooler master notepal XL ). My laptop no longer reaches insane temperatures and believe it or not nealry doubles my frames per second in WoW when playing with max ultra 4k settings (25-30 fps instead of 14-18 fps without aftermarket cooling) which is the difference between playable and not playable. I will include a link to the opolar laptop usb fan and my original review of that product, hope this has helped in some way I have included pictures also, good luck  http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UA0C4GLC4JVP/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKU47Y2   Pros: -Can use the proprietary Graphics  Amplifier with a desktop graphics card up to a Titan X currently.

I just got this today and it works beautifully, right out of the box. The USB cable is braided nylon and will easily last a long time with proper care. The pad itself is big and easily holds my 15&#34; laptop. A 17&#34; on this pad would be no issue whatsoever. The two dials on the back are for speed of the upper and lower fans, so you can precisely control the airflow. I read about the fan hitting the mesh screen in some other reviews, but I've found that to only happen when holding the pad from the bottom where the upper fans are, which essentially forced the fan up against the metal mesh.  The only thing I would caution others to be careful about is the two small hold bars at the front; if you tend to rest your wrists on  the laptop and move them from side to side, you may accidentally slide the holder bar back down and send your laptop sliding. If you want to travel with it, a proper laptop bag/backpack with compartments will make it much easier, since they are generally spaced to hold such things. You might find it shifting about too much in a regular backpack for your liking.  I'll update this review in 6 months after some regular usage and toting about.  Update (10.01.16): It's been five months since I've started using this cooling pad. I've been travelling about with it and it really does best in a laptop bag with a separate compartment. Coil up the USB cord properly in the holder, slide it in against the bottom of the laptop and nothing can snag on the open back. Otherwise get a cheap laptop sleeve from the dollar store and throw this in it to prevent it from snagging things, especially if you're going to carry it in a large purse. Also, if you have a heavy, older laptop (especially one with a CD drive), resting your wrists on the laptop will force the metal mesh down against the fan and give you a grinding sound. If you have a newer laptop with no drives, you're fine, since they tend to be slimmer and lighter.","1"

While gaming, the laptop freezes up for 1 to 2 seconds at a time every 5 to 15 minutes.  I've spent 5 hours with ASUS customer service and the best they could do was tell me to send it in.  The problem is, I don't have a Fed Ex in my town, but I have a Fed Ex pick up spot at my wife's work.  ASUS won't send me a delivery label so I can just have it picked up.  I have to drive an hour away and give Fed Ex the instructions that were emailed me so they can print off the label.  What I loved about my Alienware was it had great customer service and tech support.    OLD REVIEW I converted from an Alienware 17x and absolutely love this new ASUS.  It's fast.  It's quiet.

Sure, it was nice to have integrated graphics for when you go portable (I'm assuming to write documents while at school or checking email on the go) but that laptop was almost 9 lbs (it was heavy). Plus, I couldn't play any games (I tested Grand Theft Auto IV and EFLC) without the game only recognizing the dedicated Intel graphics card and not the dedicated Nvidia graphics card. I reformatted the computer and restored it and returned it to Best Buy and decided to spend the dough on this laptop. I have only bought my computers either locally from brick and mortar stores, or ordered parts from online stores and assembled it together at home, but I never bought a $1,500 laptop (or product) from Amazon before. Luckily UPS got it here to Hawaii without a hitch.<br /><br />The laptop itself is pretty heavy - I limit its movement to my desk with the occasional transferring to the dining or living room table using two hands, but it's better than a huge gaming desktop that is tethered to the desk. The screen is the largest I have in my laptop arsenal (I also have a Surface Pro 2, netbook and a 13&#34; Macbook Pro), but I'm not worried about portability, and the screen IS beautiful. The keyboard is back-lit with a red color, but it's not that bright, it is bright enough for quick glances to the keyboard to use it while gaming (I use a gaming controller anyway). On the laptop's right side, the 2nd USB port is a always on USB port, so it will charge any devices connected to it when the laptop is off - whether it's on battery or on AC power, so watch out. There is no touchscreen - this is a true laptop.<br /><br />I did run a 3DMark benchmark (the newest version from Steam) and it got a score of 18,759, according to the website: &#34;better than 68% of all results&#34; with the sky diver benchmark (which was meant for the gaming laptop).<br /><br />I bought this laptop to play Grand Theft Auto V, but currently playing Grand Theft Auto IV (with real car mods and an iron man mod), GTA:EFLC (no mods) and The Sims 3 with no issues. I did run Furmark for a while to test out the cooling and so far the huge exhaust vents did their job: no crashing or freezes of the computer when it ran for 2 hours.<br /><br />So far, this laptop is the perfect computer to replace my aging 5 year old Asus gaming laptop (it had dedicated graphics too) and hopefully it will serve me for another 5 years.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- good benchmarks (3dmark Sky Diver score of 18759)<br />- good speakers (I mostly use headphones anyway)<br />- a plethora of ports (4 USB 3.0 ports; mini display port, full size HDMI port)<br />- good cooling<br />- NO Optimus technology (one graphics card)<br />- no touchscreen<br /><br />Cons:<br />- heavy (about 9 lbs)<br />- the matte finish of the cover and palm rest attracts grease from hands, but it's wipeable","1"

The power brick whirred to life and shone a green light indicating all was well. I plugged the laptop itself to the AC adapter only to find that the laptop was completely BRICKED. The orange LED battery indicator light would not appear, even after leaving it plugged in for quite some time. The battery was at 0%, would not turn on, and would not accept any AC adaptor.

This time it automatically goes to BIOS on boot up and in spite of all settings being correct, and in spite of clearing CMOS and resetting to factory settings and restarting, it just goes to BIOS again, it will never load Windows, recovery doesn't help.

I was originally going to purchase an Alienware from Dell but my order fell into a black hole I had problems just getting someone on the phone to cancel the order. I started looking for an alternative and someone mentioned Asus.<br /><br />I wanted something that I could use for gaming but put away when I wasn't using it. This fit the bill perfectly. As other reviewers have stated, it's big and heavy, mostly due to the enormous heat sinks inside. You can't really call this a laptop because it would get uncomfortable on your lap very quickly due to the heat and weight. If, however, you're looking for a gaming platform that's mobile, you should check this one out.<br /><br />I'm able to play pretty much any modern game with the settings at maximum and still get frame rates above 30. Since I purchased this, Asus has come out with newer machine that uses a slightly more powerful graphics card but if you don't want to pay the premium for the newest, you can't go wrong with the G750.","0"

And yes I plugged it in lol.  So it could be a dud or it could be due to the extremely pore packaging done. The shipping box had a ton of room for extra padding and protection from shipping but all they bothered to do was add some extra  packaging paper to the top but not enough to do anything. They didn't add anything to the bottom or the sides, didn't bother to add the obvious label &#34;FRAGILE HANDEL WITH CARE!&#34;  I mean it's only costs over 2k and is a laptop! So nothing too important or breakable..... Come on Amazon! Also the actual box that the laptop is in is also not padded, just hard cardboard. So nothing at all to protect it from getting bashed around in shipping.","8"

I pulled it out of the box , installed it under my LT, turned it on and a loud sound came from it. I pulled off my LT and the sound was coming from one the left fan. I moved it around and the only way the sound stopped, was by turning it upside down. Which told me, what I pretty much knew, the fan was out of balance. By putting it upside down, that takes the weight off of it, making it able to spin freely. I chose to return for another one, in hope it will work properly. I will try and find this review, to update about the new one.    ***Update*** I received a replacement for my first fan as explained above. This new one works excellent!! It's almost silent, while running. I had to use sticky velcro tape, on the top fan base and bottom of my laptop, to keep my laptop from sliding down. The fan has built-in tabs on the bottom, that flip up to stop the LT from sliding, but my 19\\"" LT still slid down over the tabs, just as it did with my LT table I bought for it, years ago, when I bought my LT, so it's not big deal. When I put my LT to \\""sleep\\"" the fan turns off as well, so I don't need to use the off/on button next to the USB slots, underneath the fan base. My LT now stays amazingly cool to the touch, on the bottom side. I actually originally bought this, because my cat long hair, got caught up in my LT fans, burning both fans out, which cost me almost $200 to replace. This base has very large fans, which will suck up my cat hair first, instead of my LT fans. And because these fans are so big, it will be easy to vacuum out the hair, saving me a lot of money, by not having to fix my LT fans again! Woooo Hooooooooo! :D","1"

It started up much faster than I thought it would and updated quickly. I thought Windows 8 would be much more painful to learn to use, but it is not too bad and the computer runs everything that I have tried to use. I enjoy using my computer for work reports and also enjoy some gaming with family. This computer has been able to handle Star Wars Empire at War, World of Tanks and Marvel Heroes all easily. This is all that I have had time to install and try with the computer so far. When it arrived, it had trouble staying connected to the internet. It would stay connected for a bit, then it would drop connection. I did a little research and after going into my Internet managing options, I discovered that the laptop came with an option to turn off the wireless card to save power. I unchecked the option and the computer has been connecting fine. I also have had to play with the graphics card a little bit, but the NVIDIA control panel seems easy to use. Overall, I am really enjoying this computer and hope for it's longevity. Great computer.","1"
"B00NJVRTHE","ASUS GL771JM 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014]","1","2015-05-25","Hit or Miss","I am  forced by circumstances to give a bad review to a computer I am currently using. The first Asus GL771JM I ordered from amazon was from a third party seller and was unusable as a gaming computer because the screen, while gaming ,would constantly black out and black lines ran across it as well. Returning the item was a terrible experience with the seller. Luckily.Amazon came through for me and I received a refund. My husband ordered one with the same problems with the laptop and seller (same seller)and again amazon was there for him and he returned it. I then took another chance with this same model since a family member had one and had recommended it.(bought on amazon and sold by amazon.) I ordered it from amazon not a third party and this one works. I have no trouble gaming. My husband then took another chance and reordered the same model but again from a third party seller. It came defective right from the start and was even worse. This is now three of this model Asus with the same problem. He is still fighting the selller for a full refund even with a video he took showing the problem. I did some research on the internet and found others had the same issue with this model. There were about five different causes listed and all of them were hardware related. I cannot recommend this laptop for gaming even though my current one works fine. It is hit or miss if the issues will be there or not and it is too expensive to take the risk.","2"

The downside for me is that the seller didn't provide additional services such as bloatware removal, but they were great because they recommended a software to do that, eventually I ended up uninstalling them one by one. Also comes with Windows 8, you must update to Windows 8.1 unless the seller already did that. Microsoft apperantly decided to keep half of Windows 8.1 update unless you have 99 dollars so if you're looking for the start menu, pay up I believe. Great product, my first gaming notebook, also great purchase.","0"

"B00TI6TFHQ","MSI GE Series GE60 Apache Pro-867 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (Aluminum Black)","5","2015-06-05","Great laptop for gaming, numerical processing and intense video programming","I have only had this laptop for 2 days.  So far I am really enjoying it.  The only thing I don't like too much is Windows 8.0.2 and I am looking forward to upgrading to Windows 10.  But so far, it isn't too bad, so it is usable.  I have only started populating it with the various programs I find critical.  This is going to be both a work computer and a gaming computer and I do programming to do numerical simulations.  So both functions can utilize the high performance of a laptop like this.  The next thing to install will be the programming IDEs.  I utilize C#, Python and FORTRAN.  I downloaded my games from Steam and am in the process of downloading my games from Amazon.  I have Verizon FIOS and my earlier laptop was having wireless connectivity issues so I wasn't sure if the connection problems were the laptop only or also related to Verizon FIOS.  Turned out the FIOS speed is slower than I paid for so I contacted Verizon.  The connectivity problems were with the old computer though.  This computer stays connected with no problems so far.  The Verizon FIOS speed issue is in the process of being fixed.  This laptop supports the new AC wireless standard so to take advantage of this you will need to get a new router.  So far this machine rocks for games.  I purchased Dying Light from Quake and it wouldn't play on any computer I had access to,  I installed on my old gaming computer (Windows 7) a Samsung ( great 5 year old gaming computer).  It wouldn't play there or on my work computer (Windows 7), a Dell.  I have an older desktop gaming computer which I haven't used in a while.  It runs Vista which supposedly doesn't support the game, so I didn't even try.  The long and short is Dying Light plays on this computer.  I like the screen, it has a slight matte aspect to it and the screen is very high resolution The images look like they are painted on, probably due to the higher density of pixels, in part.  The speakers are great.  I usually use earbuds though.  I have two external hard-drives hooked up through the USB 3.0 ports.  I also purchased a cooling fan base.  So far I haven't noticed significant heat issues.  My son likes the lights, i.e. the LED lighted keyboard.  I personally don't care about that, but it came with it. The keyboard has a very good feel.  I need to update the NVidia Graphics Card driver.  I didn't have time last night to download the updated driver, Apparently CUDA comes with NVidia graphics cards these days.  It used to need to be downloaded.  I spent last night working with Verizon now that I could verify that I wasn't getting the speed I was paying for.  I plan to eventually get an external optical drive as I want to install a solid state hard-drive.  I have a 240 GB solid state drive.  I also plan to install an additional 8 GB of RAM.  Once I have all of these, this system should be perfect for my needs.  It comes with a nice keyboard screen protector that you place on the keyboard to keep the keys from imprinting on the screen.  It also comes with a sleeve to slip the computer in.  These are kind of nice touches.  Longevity is also key and I will update this review if it fails too soon.  My last laptop lasted for about 5 years before developing issues that I couldn't live with.  Mainly video resets and the wireless became sporadic.  So hopefully this will last for at least that long.  The touch pad doesn't have the buttons that are equivalent to the right and left buttons on the mouse, but apparently they are there just underneath the surface of the touchpad.  I will test that out tonight.  I use and prefer a mouse, so this isn't a problem.  Also, a mouse is more appropriate for use with a gaming computer.  I was concerned that this computer would be too thick but it is actually thinner than my old Samsung laptop so it fits all my bags.  The 1 TB hard-drive is already partitioned into two partitions.  Long and short, this is, in my opinion, a great laptop for gaming and intensive numerical programmingand video intensive applications.  I was a little concerned because I only knew of MSI as a computer board manufacturer the last time I looked at purchasing a new computer.  I believe in purchasing gaming laptops to future proof my computers as you can usually get very high end components at a much more reasonable price than purchasing other types of computers.  It used to be you would need to get a new computer every 2-3 years to stay up to date.  But if you buy a gaming system, it stays up to date for maybe 5-7 years.  So the way I look at it you can spend twice as much on a gaming computer and still save a little money over time.  Of course this means it does need to last 5-7 years.  My last laptop lasted just over 5 years so it worked out, barely.  It can still be used but it does have spotty wifi.  If this lasts 6 years I will be very happy, and anything beyond that is extra joy.  I am still setting this computer up but it has met all my expectations so far.  If I hit a major snag, I will update this review.  Minor update.  The Touchpad works fine.  the left mouse button is on the bottom of the touchpad on the left and the right mouse button is on the bottom of the touchpad on the right.  The whole portion is the actual touchpad.  I don't usually use the touch screen preferring a mouse.  I have noticed it boots very fast even without a solid state drive.  It gets to the login screen within 35 seconds.  I find the keyboard has a very natural feel for me and is a pleasure to type with.  The painted on matte screen is a function of the high density of the pixels, at least that is my guess.  It took me about 3 days but I did get used to Windows 8.  I still plan to update to Windows 10 when it comes out.  I have done 2 or 3 update cycles so far and have yet to get the windows update symbol on the bottom right.  Oh well.  When I take the bottom off to install the additional memory and/or the SSD, I also hope to redo the thermal paste connection to the heat pipe.  Iwill update this review when I do this.","2"

"B00NVV2B98","ASUS ROG G751JT-WH71(WX) 17-Inch Gaming Laptop, Nvidia GeForce GTX 970M, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD (Win 10 Version)","5","2015-06-13","Completely blew away Expectations and beyond.","I've held back from reviewing this laptop, despite having had it for going on six months now. Particularly, I just wanted to be sure that when I DID give my review, that it would have sufficient ground on why I felt the way I did.<br /><br />To start off with, I will comment on how great of a deal I consider this computer to be priced at. Starting about a year ago, I realized that I wanted a laptop, as I was soon to be moving. Looking around, there were a few in particular I had in mind. For a long time, I had been a satisfied customer with HP before. I had heard that Alien Ware made great systems, albeit pricey, but alas still good systems. And then, after some major comparisons between features and reliability, I came across the ASUS ROG line. I began drooling over the idea of buying an ASUS ROG laptop, my eye set particularly on their higher end model costing roughly $2.5k. For several months, I saved and tried cutting back on any personal expense I could. I even started working extra hours at my job, which played a great role in all of this. My circumstances were growing in difficulty and so I eventually settled and bought an HP laptop. It cost roughly $1k and for the price, wasn't a bad deal.<br /><br />However, the system just did not match up to the expectations I had, which were probably in part due to my attraction towards the ASUS systems. So, I sent it back. While owning the HP, I had installed a nice collection of games on it, as I knew I wanted a system that could at least handle a portion of the games I had. This is where ASUS made itself such a strong contender. But, the goal of saving up for the $2.5k system just felt so daunting. I finally decided I would give one of the lower priced models a go and that if I didn't like it, I'd send it back and keep saving for the higher priced one. The price hasn't changed much for this since I bought it, but I looked at the ROG models that Amazon had available and settled on this one, the $1.5k model.<br /><br />I had read multiple reviews of people who complained about the size and weight of the machine. But, as I would say to anyone interested, this is a *gaming* laptop. It is meant to supplement, or even replace, a person's gaming rig setup. So right off the bat, I knew battery life, notebook dimensions, and total weight were all going to be on the side of being &#34;sub par&#34; (if that is even the right word) to industry standards as far as it goes for a person seeking mobility. But none of these things trumped my interest.<br /><br />My first impression with the laptop was that the exterior is made of a slick matte plastic that I assumed would get scratched very easily. Between moving it back and forth between my room, the living room, and my friends houses, the exterior is still sharp as ever. If your fingers have any grease or oil on them, it WILL show very prominently, so keep that in mind. There are many people that have complained about the screen of this laptop having an off-color tint to it, but I will say right away that this wasn't in the slightest bit a problem for me. If you tilt your head to a very awkward angle and squint, it does get a bit of glare, but I really have to try to achieve that. A laptop with a 17 inch screen, my word, is a god-send. I am very spoiled, as my desktop rig has two 32&#34; and &#34;42 inch LCD screens running for it, so I am used to having a wall of view for my computing. This screen is just perfect for being a foot or two away from my face while lounging.<br /><br />Now, I want to comment on the hardware itself, in this machine. From a cold boot, it takes roughly 10 seconds to reach the Windows log-in screen. Comparable, if not better than, my desktop system. After logging in, it is usually another 5 to 10 seconds until everything is fully loaded and ready to go. Very satisfactory. And here is my favorite part - since I am a gamer, I thought why the hell not push the boundaries and see what this baby could handle. Sim City - like a charm. Elder Scrolls Skyrim - maxed specs. Grand Theft Auto V - high for most and ultra for some specs in the game, no lag. Storage space - I have a total of 84 full games installed on this computer as well as 80 GB of music. Truth be told, I am running low on available space on the drive, but I am most certainly going to install another hard drive in here once I can get confirmation that I'm buying a good model for this system. Everything boots up quick as ever, I never get any lag while running power-hungry applications, and I can count on one hand the number of times I have had running errors.<br /><br />Now, for some negatives. My first and probably my most serious negative feedback on this system is the power supply and plug. For those that don't know yet, the system comes with a massive power block that is about 8&#34; x 3&#34; x 2&#34;. It gets hot very frequently and has actually gotten hot enough to the point that it turned itself off and wouldn't charge the computer for a solid 30 minutes. Scared me a bit as these power supplies are on the pricey side. Another thing, the plug is CONSTANTLY coming loose from the adapter feed in the computer. When I first started noticing it, I took it to be that it got bumped while on my lap and would get knocked out. But there have actually been times where I've been looking at the laptop sitting on a desk and had the &#34;battery charging&#34; symbol go dead and wouldn't start back up again until wiggling and pushing back in the cord. That can get quite old when you leave for a couple hours and then come back to a completely dead computer because somehow the cord wiggled out. Next complaint, in line with this, is the battery. The detailed info on this product made it seem like a solid 3 to even 4 hours could be achieved on its own charge..but I'm lucky to get close to 2 hours of battery life on this machine, and that is not even while playing games, just browsing the web or instant messaging. BUT! You shouldn't expect the battery life of a thin-book or tablet, as this is a power hungry machine. Also, I've seen it mentioned in reviews here, but the extra line of keys at the top of the keyboard can get disorienting, as the screen video capture hot key is located where the Esc key is usually located, so I've countlessly pressed that when I intended to use the escape key. Lastly, the DVD drive is insanely sensitive. I am always bumping it by accident and having the tray pop out. Not a huge ordeal, but an irritant, non the less.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful machine. When I saw that it was able to run all of my games without any hiccups, I no longer felt the need to save up the additional $1k. It would be nice to have the extra hard drive space, ram, and a blu-ray player, but this system has met and exceeded every benchmark I have put before it. If you are looking for a system that will at a bare-minimum *play* every game out on the market, this will absolutely meet your expectation. If you're looking for a system that will actually have the power to even surpass some desktop rigs, this laptop will surprise you, I promise that. I truly hope that this computer will last me a few good solid years. As long as it can boot up and load a game without much or any lag, I intend to keep this as my primary machine.","2"

However, i don't know why but somehow my first order of this item was defective. Its graphics card has issues which caused the laptop to display black screen after a sleep or hibernation, I needed to hard reset it holding the power button for 5 seconds. Moreover, when the windows desktop is displayed, the animation of windows 8 such as mouse over to the edge of the screen would show up the time and the day on the bottom left of the screen but the animation was pixeled and the image is broken. Furthermore, its touch pad's right button wasn't working properly, you had to press really hard to make it work.  After seeing these issues I returned the laptop to Amazon and they have sent me a new one. Everything seemed fine with this one up until I realized in a black scene a bright dot (dead pixel) to the left of the center of the screen. Then a few days later I wanted to install the Witcher 3 using the discs, and the discs seem to be causing a loud noise and making a huge vibration while its spinning in the BD-ROM drive. Then I removed the disc because it would probably destroy a few electronic parts in the computer due to immense vibration. Then I thought maybe I had loaded the disc into the drive improperly, then tried it a few more times, and only like 1 out of 5 times it worked without that loud noise and critical vibration. Also, its speaker pops with too much noise especially when talking to someone on Skype.  Well I really do love this Asus laptop's looks, and its specifications and I do trust in Asus's quality in laptop making. But I honestly don't know what to do in my case. Because I am not in USA anymore and I don't have the time to return the laptop, because I need my computer with me. I payed almost $2500 with all the fast cargo fees and the taxes, however the second laptop i received from Amazon is again not in perfect shape. Never before had issues with any of the items I bought from Amazon, but this laptop made a lot of headaches to me.  All in all, if it wasn't for all these problems, the laptop deserves 5 stars, but unfortunately in my case it gets 2 stars from me, and those 2 stars is for the Amazon because they have sent me a replacement, though unluckily I have issues with it as well.","2"

One of the 12 GB partition are for the recovery disk, by why on earth did they break the rest of it up into a 90GB for the OS and  ~130GB for who know what.

I installed a few games within the first two days of ownership, CS:GO, League of Legends, L4D2, and Bioshock Infinite. All the games ran perfectly, but I mainly used the laptop for some word browsing and word doc for the first week. Than why the 1 star? At the end of the first week, while playing Napoleon: Total War, the laptop completely crashed. When I tried to start the laptop, it went to the bios, the OS no longer working. With such high specs, I didn't expect an old game like NTW to crash it. I contacted Amazon and got a replacement that arrived yesterday. I decided to just load CS:GO and LoL since those are the only games I play, but when I started LoL, the screen became distorted, shortly crashing after this started. Tried CS:GO and the same thing happened. Downloaded Civ 5 and Civ Beyond Earth, same thing happened. I don't know if I &#34;pushed&#34; the laptop too far or if I just had a bad luck spree, but as my first experience with ASUS, I won't be coming back.

The case also seems to be very smudge-prone. Even when handling with clean hands, I seem to leave little smudges over the lid and case which tends to detract from the overall look. I haven't discovered a way to keep that from happening, so I clean it off with a bit of Windex and a rag every few days. Aside from those, this laptop has been relatively issue-less for me since I purchased it nearly a month ago with none of the DoA or bootup issues that have been reported by others. (Every product line is bound to have a few defective units here and there, get used to it and just send it back for another.)<br /><br />I've been able to run several resource-high and middling games without trouble (EG: Metro, Dead Space 3, Endless Legend). The speakers do leave something to be desired when listening to music or catching subtle things like footsteps when playing games, but are fine and powerful enough for Netflix watching from a small distance away. (Get yourself a nice headset if you plan on using this as your main gaming rig.) It's a very quiet rig, and even when running games I don't tend to hear the CPU fan blasting away. And it doesn't heat up all that quickly either - remaining only warm to the touch while playing lower end video games or binging Netflix.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.","0"

Given the money spent, and how much of a risk this kind of purchase can be, I feel obligated to clear some stuff up for people who were asking the same questions I was and looking for the same function.<br />There are a few things I want to note before i write a book.<br /><br />1st: This laptop will MOST DEFINITELY replace a Gaming desktop built with quality parts.<br /><br />2nd: For the price its just unbelievably powerful.<br /><br />3rd: The laptop feels very solid, and its definitely NOT lightweight- its not a bad thing but i plan to get a backpack for this laptop and ditch my targus laptop case because of the weight.<br /><br />I will start of by saying, I needed a gaming PC that was portable. I was fed up with being planted in one spot for too long. So I shopped around for a few weeks and found this ASUS ROG lappy!! I am definitely satisfied.<br /><br />I was coming from a gaming rig I had built myself. I needed a laptop that can play more than 90% of all of my PC games in my library, if not ALL OF THEM. this laptop exceeded my expectations by delivering on astounding performance on all of my games while on ultra settings and not only that but the IPS panel is just Incredible-<br /><br />The keyboard has its flaws (as far as layout and function are concerned) steam big picture mode?? really asus? and wish the gesture pad/mouse pad was offset to the right a little further underneath the space bar. the pad sits directly under the space bar and it just doesn't feel right. my only gripes and they are small. the great thing is that ALL of the Keys, mouse pad and buttons work 100% (i guess some people complained about a key or two not working or being loose)- not a problem here.<br /><br />Having a big picture mode button for steam- really unnecessary (for me at least) HOWEVER having a specific button for Shadowplay is plain AWESOME!<br /><br />*DISPLAY:<br />It is truly 1920x1080 @75Hz refresh rate (Some people complained in the reviews about a yellow tinted display, but this problem is non -existent on my laptop) the display is just absolutely gorgeous, bright and crisp and color are true and accurate. Very good viewing angles when your sitting on the couch with your relatives or friends and your watching some Go-Pro HD videos on YouTube :P<br />completely jaw dropping. :)<br /><br />*CPU:<br />one of the best Mobile CPUs hands down! 4 cores (8 total threads @ 2.50GHz each) max turbo boost up to 3.5 Ghz<br /><br />*GPU: Put it this way, I had a 3GB GTX 660Ti (decent GFX card even till this day) in my desktop..... The GTX 970M is incredible and definitely a major upgrade over a more than capable and great Full sized Desktop GFX card such as the 660 Ti<br /><br />*HDD: I am a little weirded out that the HDD was separated into two different Volumes (a C Drive -the drive the OS is on and a D Drive- I recon the D drive is for another install location for games/media dedication I guess.) Not sure why they would do that for anything other than organization maybe? I dont know if its beneficial to HDD performance or not. Its not a bad thing so far. I have games evenly distributed/installed on both to alleviate overstorage on both volumes. I guess if i really wanted to fix this I could go into the management console under disk management and merge the two back into a single drive option..... but its fine the way it is currently.<br /><br />All RAM seems to check out. i might add more later on but 16GB seems like plenty for what i use it for.<br /><br />*Optical drive:<br /><br />SO SO glad this comes with an Optical Drive as most laptops these days are getting rid of them (i never thought i would see the day CDs/DVD/Blurays would become somewhat Obsolete.)<br /><br />BUT beware, the Pictures on Amazon and the actual ASUS Box/Packaging the laptop came in LITERALLY SHOW A BLURAY drive installed- LUCKILY the info on Amazon for this laptop<br />specify it is actually a DVDMulti- im gladi payed attention to this before i bought this laptop or i would have been disappointed for sure.

It has been a long time since I have been excited about a computer purchase. Even with Windows 8.1 this is a great laptop and a great deal.<br />Pros: 16GB Ram, Processor, Decent Video Card, PRICE!!!! (I was looking at a few brands with same specs they were all at least a couple of hundred dollars more. I know some people were complaining about the matte screen, but I like it.<br />Cons: Brushed aluminum case is a finger print magnet, but when it is clean it a good looking laptop. In dark rooms keyboard does need to be back-lit to see the keys.<br />Overall: I really enjoy this laptop and would definitely recommend this one. I bought it for school work and to do some minimal gaming. You do have to configure it to use the video card rather than the chipset. The GTX 860m handles everything I play so no complaints.","0"

"B00T7EXKLG","ASUS G751JL 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","5","2015-06-29","So far, so good","I've owned this laptop for less than two weeks, so my views are preliminary, but I thought I should offer my initial review.<br /><br />I'm not a gamer, but I decided to look for a gaming laptop for the power and video capabilities.  I figured I could buy one at the lower end of the gamer price range, and it would be good enough for my purposes.  This laptop is a monster, built like a tank.  My old laptop was a Dell XPS17, equal in size but without the sheer heft of this one.  I decided to replace the Dell, instead of wiping the drive and starting from scratch, when one of the two hinges shattered.  On the ASUS, there's a central hinge, which works really smoothly.  It's sturdy as all get-out and looks like it'll last forever.  I don't know why other laptops don't use one like it.<br /><br />The appearance:  The ASUS looks great.  I'm too old to use the word &#34;awesome,&#34; but you can pretend I've said it.  I love the form.  I love the fan vents in the back.  And the default wallpaper on the desktop, which I've directed Windows 8.1 to boot to, shows an image of this laptop highlighting the fan vents, with a red and gray background.  It's, er, awesome.<br /><br />The keyboard keys feel good and respond well to touch.  I do agree with people who have criticized the extra keys.  (I constantly hit the &#34;record&#34; key at the top left, because I expect it to be the ESC key, which most keyboards have at the top left.  But fortunately, the real ESC key is right below, and the record function closes with ESC.)  The keyboard is backlit.  I would have preferred white backlighting, but I suppose the red is cool in its own way.  It's just not as practical.<br /><br />Initial boot times have ranged from about 35 seconds to a little less than a minute from power-on to the stripey page.  From there, it's roughly 15 seconds to the desktop.  I guess I would have expected slightly faster times, but maybe I'm not being realistic.<br /><br />The hard drive comes formatted into two primary partitions, one labelled OS and one labelled Data, but what's called the OS partition actually contains not only the OS but basically everything else on the computer as well.  The Data partition is completely empty.  Downloads and new installations default to the OS partition.  I suppose there's a way to wipe the drive and start with literally nothing but the OS in the OS partition, but I didn't want to go to the trouble.  So instead, I merged the two partitions with the Windows utility built into Windows 8.1.<br /><br />I haven't really tested the video capabilities.  As I said, I'm not a gamer.  But I did search out video game trailers, and the graphics on this laptop are beautiful.  Maybe at some point, I'll test the frame rates, and so on, but for now, I have no complaints.<br /><br />I've been surprised at how quietly the computer runs.  It's true I haven't run heavy-duty games on it, but my wife's desktop, which also has never run games, sounds like a jet engine in comparison.  This is a quiet computer.<br /><br />One clear failing in the computer is that the external speakers are mediocre, but this is not a grave flaw in my opinion.  Any time I'm going to listen to something that requires good sound, I'm going to use headphones, anyway.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen so far, the laptop deserves a 5.two primary partitions, one labelled OS and one labelled Data, but what's called the OS partition actually contains not only the OS but basically everything else on the computer as well.

I bought this as an upgrade to the Toshiba Qosmio X75 as I was getting very annoyed at the heat dispelled on the right side.  Thus far here are my thoughts on the system.<br /><br />I went ahead and began the setup process only to find that none of the Asus ROG software and utilities were installed (i had bought this as a used product from Amazon Warehouse.  I quickly downloaded all of the Asus programs that I would need and also installed my own programs  One major problem is that Asus doesn't provide a Blu-ray software program to play DVDs and Blu-rays.  So I went ahead and downloaded Potplyer, a free software that plays back DVDs and Blu-rays unlike VLC Player.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Great specs<br />-Excellent visual display<br />-Great graphics card, I can run all my games at the highest settings<br />-Computer stays cool without little heat and quiet fans<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Trackpad is fairly terrible in terms of gestures so it's not a good fit for Windows 8<br />-Keyboard and Track buttons are fairly mushy<br />-Optical tray is easy to open without even trying<br /><br />One more thing I discovered is that although there is no media buttons for play, pause, skipping tracks, you can use the directional keys to do the same task.

"B00SIJGRJ8","Alienware 17 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop","2","2015-07-09","The Good: The little alienware logo draws attention and my ...","I needed a laptop with serious graphics power for my business (3D/Gaming).  Alienware has always had a reputation for being an outstanding option for high-end gaming.  This laptop had the top of the line graphics card at the time and a decent set of specs.  I compared it to the competition, but was sold on the Alienware because of the longer battery life.<br /><br />The last laptop I bought was a Toshiba 17&#34;.  I paid about $800 in 2007.  That laptop still works.  I put Linux on it last year and gave it to my wife.<br /><br />This laptop is a 17&#34;.  I paid $2000 for it in 2015.  Obviously, if I'm paying more than twice the price, I expect more than twice the computer.  Did I get that?  I honestly can't say I did.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The little alienware logo draws attention and my kids like it.  The screen seems pretty good.  And the battery life is pretty good.  Of all the things I like so far, the battery life is it.  The only other thing that I like is the fact that you can purchase an external housing for a full-sized graphics card.  That gives a lot of potential upgrade options and makes this a fairly good machine.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />For starters, it wasn't until after I bought this that I read all about the issues with the power supply not being strong enough to drive the graphics card to its full potential.  The long and short of it is that you have to call Dell and demand a replacement.  I did.  It took about 3 days to get here and I had to argue with them to get it.<br /><br />Second, and this is the one that really steams me.  There are two graphics cards in this.  The first is the built-in Intel chip which the laptop uses for practically everything.  The second is the Nvidia.  There is no way to force the computer to disable the Intel chip and just use the Nvidia.  Oh, sure, you can tell the Nvidia control panel to use the Nvidia as the main card, but in my experience running Unreal Engine 4.8, it was still using the Intel chip.  I triedrunning the Oculus Rift and it was being pushed entirely through the Intel chip.  I bought this for the Nvidia graphics card.  The fact that I can't force the Nvidia card to be used is absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />Third, while there are two hard drives in here, the C: drive is really small.  I put on 3DS Max, Maya, Photoshop and Unreal 4.8.  Then decided to put on Unreal 4.7 and it failed because I had run out of space.  That's nuts.<br /><br />Fourth, the keyboard layout leaves a lot to be desired.  I'm very picky about how the keyboard layout.  I want my fingers to naturally fall on the keys.  But there are special function keys on the left which require your hands to shift over, resulting in an unnatural feel.  I constantly find myself mistyping and having to correct myself.<br /><br />Fifth, this thing gets crazy hot.  It's definitely not something you will want to put on your lap and use for any length of time.<br /><br />Sixth, the battery life, while very good, is a little misleading.  At the higher charges, it holds out very well.  But when it got to about 20%, it told me I had about another 45 minutes left.  Then in about 3 minutes it powered itself down.  I'm used to my Android phone or iPad.  When they say they've got 10% battery left, there's still a good hour left.  So it was a bit of a disappointment to see the battery go into a sucking vortex.<br /><br />Seventh, the design.  I know some people love it.  I think it's clunky and awkward.  We had a friend come visit us and she saw the laptop and said, &#34;Wow, that must be an old laptop.&#34;  I didn't have the heart to tell her that it was brand new and that I'd paid $2000 for it.<br /><br />Summary<br />I've had this laptop for about a month now.  It's far too heavy to lug around.  It's too hot to use while sitting on the couch.  It doesn't have the hard drive space to put all the software I need.  And the software I do have apparently doesn't work at full capacity, first because the power cord that ships with the unit isn't strong enough and second because the computer defaults to using the vastly inferior Intel chip for most activities.  My $800 Toshiba with its 17&#34; screen cost far less and apparently operates just as well.  Do I regret this purchase.  Absolutely.  I'll use this laptop because I don't have much of a choice.  But if someone had laid things out for me like I'm doing here, I would have saved my money.  Hopefully you can do the same.","6"

No, that wouldn't be fair to ASUS. But I thought you should know that anyway.<br /><br />I'm docking a star because this trackpad is a pig orgy. Seriously this might be the worst trackpad I've ever used. It sticks, the buttons are flush and I constantly click them by accident. It's near-impossible to navigate anything with this trackpad. A fairly small gripe -- a wireless mouse solved this problem easily. Also, the speakers are fair at best. No low-end. But who plays games on laptop speakers anyway?<br /><br />Overal, this is a great machine for the price. I paid less than $1000 and even though mine looks like a homeless man slept with it under a bridge, it's still a powerhouse at that price point. Even at $1100 or so new, this is a great mid-high range gaming laptop with high-quality parts. It benchmarks well, shows excellent frame rates on high-to-ultra settings on all games I've tried it on so far and run very quietly. The fans ramp up a bit under load, but it's by no means loud. It gets warm, but not uncomfortably so.<br /><br />This is another great entry to the ROG series and I'd definitely recommend it. Just make sure to get a mouse.","0"

"B0105JD1HE","Acer Aspire E5 17.3 Full HD Gaming Laptop","5","2015-07-16","Good laptop and good specs for the price.","First off I'd like to say it is possible to use Windows 7 on this laptop. That was my biggest concern when I bought it because I'm not a fan of Windows 8. The trick is you need to take some time and use drivers from similar model Acers. When I have more time I'll try to edit this with my specific drivers but just know it is possible I'm using it now and all the features are working. Just take some time.<br /><br />Now for the product. This laptop has very nice specs for its price point. I knew just judging by the specs it would be able to run most games decently with its 2gb videoram. It runs Dota 50+ Fps all setting maxed and runs CS:GO 60 fps constantly. It is also nice that it has both integrated graphics and the dedicated video card and it will autodetect which you need to use. For regular browsing your intel 5500(I believe) will be running so your card wont burn out as fast and when you open up an intensive game your 940m will kick in. The 8 gb of ram will run whatever you want without much of a hassle and the 2.2 ghz processor, while not fantastic, will overclock to 2.7 ghz when needed. Its not the most powerful laptop but you aren't buying the most powerful one. The fans keep it nice and cool as well.<br /><br />The build of the laptop seem quality at first glance, and in most cases its a very nice laptop but it has some downsides. First off, the cover of the laptop is a nice faux-vinyl which I'm a fan of. It doesn't leave case smudges that much and overall just looks very nice. The keyboard of the laptop looks nice but it is definitely flimsy. However it works fine just dont jam on it like you're angry and you're not going to have a problem. The keyboard has a million different functions on it from quick monitor shifting if you dual screen or use a VGA port and brightness and sound levels like you'd expect among other things. In this regard it's great. The ports on the laptop are sometimes hard to use and the hinges dont seem very sturdy so sometimes I justdont bother closing it at all.<br /><br />This warrants a section on its own. The touch pad is terrible and its in an inconvenient location not centered but slightly to the left so you're going to be accidentally pressing it. Luckily theres a keybinding to disable the touchpad. Use a mouse. There are not separate left and right click buttons and it just isnt responsive in general. I'm giving this review a 5 star in spite of the trackpad because they make it so easy to disable the trackpad like Acer knew it was bad. Good call boys I'm really thanking you for that one. Use a mouse.<br /><br />The screen is alright. The viewing angles are pretty bad but its a good screen otherwise and doesnt seem like it'll be breaking soon. Dont be afraid of the 1366x768 aspect ratio it looks fine. This is not a $1,000 laptop and youre not going to find a 1080x720 for this price with these specs.<br /><br />The ports on the laptop are very impressive. There are 2 USB 3.0s and a USB 2.0. A VGA and an HDMI port for multimedia, an ethernet port. No CD drive so make sure you have an USB optical drive.<br /><br />Finally, this is a note to the shippers, the laptop was not packaged very securely. The laptop was in the standard Acer supplied box but the shipping box literally had some wadded up paper as the buffer inside the box. The laptop was definitely being shaken during shipping because it was sliding when I shifted the box gently. FedEx isnt the most careful company and items packaged like this are a liability. Fast shipping though gotta love that prime. Not sure how fast it would be without but the company seems well respected so I assume fast.<br /><br />Overall good laptop. Specs are great for the price.","13"

Everything from the exterior and interior, it is literally everything I've ever wanted. I've been a pc gamer since I was 12. I'm 24 now and I've been through many pc's. I could never handle anything better than say, a 2d video game that ran on dx9 that only took maybe 20-30% of my physical memory. The second I launched an music app it would lag, freeze or crash. This computer will handle anything you throw at it. I am an avid counter strike go player and playing this game on max settings on my led, 1 ms Asus gaming monitor, I am in absolute bliss. I am performing better than I ever have. The lights on the keyboard are very effective for night, the weight isn't so heavy, and I love the aluminum finish as the cover. Overall, coming from a guy who never really invested more than $400-500 on a laptop, invest the extra $500-$600 on this standard version because chances are it will be all you need. This laptop is an absolute beast of a machine. Things you may want to be aware of, it does run rather hot at times, but it seems to cool off after a while. Other than that, there isn't a single negative thing I can say about this. Would highly recommend for the average, casual gamer who is looking for a very reasonable price for some serious and respectable craftsmanship.","3"

So my hands and reflexes have naturally become attuned to using a controller. However, I have been traveling for work more and wanted something portable but would allow me to still experience AAA games with good graphics at good fps. When deciding on which laptop to get, I literally spent 2 weeks straight debating/researching. After reading reviews and doing a comparison, I decided on this gem of a machine, and I have ZERO regrets! This thing is awesome! This thing plays all current games (Battlefield 4, Hardline, Cities Skylines, etc.) at 1080p 60fps at max settings with no problem. I played BF4 on this one day and sat it down side by side with BF4 on my Xbox One, and this thing smokes it in both graphic quality and smoothness.  The speakers are great to me, but I've heard others mention that there are better alternatives out there. But I use a headset to play games anyway, so this was an irrelevant factor. The screen, at 17.3 inches, is a great size for a laptop. I will say that the screen does take a little tinkering with to get the best of it, as the gamma/brightness levels are a little off at default.  All in all, if you're on the fence about getting this, GO FOR IT! I am somewhat of a cheap skate, but I bought this and am have not looked back! I dare to say that I may even be converting into a PC gamer! Dun dun dunnnnnnn!  Now excuse me while I go play some more BF4.","2"

I ordered this charger thinking it would be a cheap, no-name charger. I was very surprised it was a name-brand charger that has been used with many other laptop brands. I compared it to the Pwr+ and do not see any reason to pay over 100% more for the same thing. Now to get to the details.<br /><br />This charger is about twice the size of the original. It has the same output specs for voltage and amps as the original that came with my 2015.  I have noticed it generated much less heat while charging than the original (probably due to size, and the ability to cool quicker.) It has the same 3 prong plug that the original had, so the smaller cord for me is swappable. The plug into the laptop fits just as snug and tight as the original charger.<br /><br />I had my doubts when I ordered, but was surprised at the quality charger I received.

I bought it through the reseller Xotic PC, from whom I have purchased laptops before. As usual, they do not disappoint. So far, I am loving this machine. There are a few things to note, however. The advertised product lists an i7-4710 processor which runs at about 2.5 Ghz. However, my machine came with a slight increase to a i7-4720 processor. This was a nice surprise, though I hear reports of others who have received the advertised processor. I also received one that came with an IPS monitor as opposed to a TN monitor. Previously, this unit sold with a TN monitor, whereas the GT72 Dominator Pro 445 and up came with an IPS. So there seems to have been a stealth update recently. This is good news for those who have yet to purchase, but you should keep in mind that right now it could fall down to the luck of the draw.<br /><br />Now, on to the pros and cons!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. If you are a gamer, you will appreciate the way this machine handles even the most recent games. I have played Dragon Age Inquisition on it with everything set to ultra, and I did not experience a single hiccup. My desktop can only run everything at almost ultra, and I built that just this past summer.<br /><br />2. MSi's software is actually very useful. If you are the type to do a clean install whenever you buy a new laptop, you might want to consider hanging on to some of these programs. Some are actually essential to controlling the laptops extra functions, which I will get to in a minute. the Dragon Gaming Center is a great way to monitor CPU usage, GPU, disk, memory, and so on. It also offers measurements of your temp, though certain third party software gives more information.<br /><br />3. This machine seems to run very quietly for a gaming laptop. I rarely notice the sound of the fans unless cooler blaster is turned on, in which case they can get pretty loud but never loud enough to hear over the action in your game. if you are not playing a game, there is no reason to turn this on, so you won't have to deal with it then.<br /><br />4. As for the temps, they stay very low. Sitting idle in my otherwise hot office, the cpu is around 35C. I noticed it go up to around 60C after playing Dragon Age for a bit, but I never felt it. The wrist area stays fairly cool in fact due to the design.<br /><br />5. The keyboard is pretty nifty too. If you like pretty colors, you will enjoy this keyboard. Just as the description reads, there are three areas that you can adjust, changing each to almost any color you can imagine. There are also patterns, such as a breathing pattern where the keys will almost glow. It is not as customizable as, say, a Razr Black Widow. You can also program macros fairly easily, which should make MMO fans happy.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I can only think of a few cons, most of which are superficial.<br /><br />1. This things is proving to be a finger print magnet. On the other hand, I tend to have greasy palms so it could just be me.<br /><br />2. If you are planning to carry it around, be prepared to shoulder a bit of weight. I had to buy a new bag just to fit it. Of course, I knew this from the get go since it is, after all, a 17.3&#34; laptop. I'm a big guy though, so it does not really bother me much.<br /><br />3. I'm a little disappointed in the audio. The sound is not bad, per say, and I've yet to try hooking it up to genuine speakers, but the built in speakers are softer than my old laptop. My old one was a Dell XPS and had some amazing sound. Still, the sound here is plenty good and would be an upgrade for most I think.","1"

I'm not happy with this screen and now it will probably have to be replaced. Nothing like going without your computer for 3 weeks while it's repaired. I would rate it 2.5 stars really.  First, the screen. It's got a brown tint to everything. Not sure what's up with that but I've seen reviews of other Lenovo laptops that have the same problem. It does come with the Superfish spyware installed but it's easy to uninstall if you to to the Lenovo website and get their uninstaller. For the games that I play it seems to work fine. I don't run it at high settings, just normal and it looks fine on my external monitor. As long as you use an external monitor you don't get the brown tint so it is definitely the monitor causing it. It really sucks that the screen is this way. I have no idea why they use the hybrid hard drive.  It doesn't boot any faster than my previous laptop or my current desktop.","5"

Techie professional student purchasing this item &#34;refurb/used&#34; at significantly off retail, after agonizingly researching various comparable models and purchasing options.  Perfect reviews tipped the scale for me.  Allow me to interject some sadly accurate facts about my own experience, so that future purchasers may be forewarned when making a purchasing decision.<br /><br />Pro: $1500 laptop for $1000, with 2 day shipping, from a fairly well rated seller<br /><br />Cons: Right off the bat, &#34;two day shipping&#34; took six days.  When I contacted Amazon on day 3, and they contacted FedEx, the latter indicated that the item had been shipped in such a way that it would take a minimum of four days to reach the destination, and that there was no way to expedite it.  Okaaay - stuff happens.  Item finally arrived today (about 3 hours ago, at the time of this review).  The shipping box was *much* too large, and was obviously poorly packed from the moment the delivery guy handed it to me.  I could tip it one way or the other, and feel the computer inside slide freely from one end of the large box to the other before hitting it.  Corner on the shipping box had been breached open/taped back closed as well.  Shipper didn't need my signature for a $1000+ laptop (when shipping method had insisted that signature from an adult would be required?).  Opened the box: suspicions confirmed.  Pretty standard retailed sized laptop box in a shipping box that measures 16&#34;Dx7.5H&#34;x26&#34;L, with so little brown packing paper that it seems to have been thrown in as an afterthought.  Unboxed the item further.  Relieved to find that it was enclosed in foam support packing pieces within the retail laptop box.  Upon further inspection, it's clear that somebody had removed the entire bottom, unplugged two small wires (they were still unplugged, I took pictures of it), snapped the bottom back on carelessly (badly breaking the plastic bottom near one of the USB ports, but still screwing it down and leaving a gap along that edge between upper and lower case parts), not to mention stripping out 1 or 2 of the case screws that hold the bottom on.  I'd removed the bottom in the first place to install the extra 8gb of RAM I purchased to upgrade this system, and to see how involved it was going to be to install the 500GB SSD I'd also purchased for the system.  Now I was started to get upset.  Plugged the wires back into their ports, set and carefully superglued the broken case edges to repair that damage (still hoping to keep it at that point), installed the RAM, replaced the bottom, and turned it on.  System had been restored to factory (as it should have), and started the 8.1 setup process.  Got to the part where you can sign into your microsoft account - had an error.  Clicked the &#34;try again&#34; button, still and error.  Figured it was because I hadn't setup WiFi yet, skipped and finished Setup.  Once to the desktop and ready to go, got the laptop hooked up to my WiFi right away.  Seemed to connect to both my 2.4 and 5.0 channels just fine.  Then I tried to do a Windows update, it kept failing.  Then I noticed that it thought it was Sept 30th, 2046.  I reset it manually, made sure clock was set to sync with nist.time.gov, and tried to download the backup utility I've used very sucessfully before (from the wellknown Download.com).  Kept telling me &#34;publisher not verified&#34;.  As soon as the download finished, system crashed.  Upon reboot, time had set itself back to Sep 30th, 2046.  Windows update still broken.  Touchpad was acting up too, zooming when I tried to scroll, clicking when I wasn't trying to, and a few times refusing to click when I *did* try to.  It was connecting to webpages okay right then, so I followed a hyperlink from the Windows Update failure - but Windows had no record of that specific error number, so that was no help.  I looked around a little more, found that Windows wasn't activated/verified.  Okay!  That must be it, I'll just activate my perfectly legal OEM copy of Windows, then stuff will start working, right?  No. Multiple failures to reach the Windows server to validate the copy of Windows on the machine.  Okay, I've had to validate manually before, I'll just get the official sticker with the product key and call the hotline.  Guess what?  No sticker anywhere.  No proof that this is a valid copy of Windows included anywhere one the machine or in the package, ergo, no was to validate this copy of Windows as genuine.<br /><br />Deep breath.  Decided to give it one last chance, on the off chance that something had screwed up when it had been restored to factory last time.  Did another factory restore, started it up again...  Same.  Exact.  Issues.<br /><br />As much as a seriously wish it were otherwise, this has been the worst purchasing experience I've had in a long time.  Every aspect of this particular purchase (shipping, hardware, and software) was a failure in some way or another.  I removed my extra RAM from the machine, and have already boxed it back up.  It's their problem again now.<br /><br />Emptor caveat.","2"

I have played consoles for most of my life, other than the occasional Counterstrike 1.6 session on my busted Dell laptop. I have wanted to get into PC gaming for a while but I also needed a new laptop for business related purposes. This laptop definitely fits the bill! I have since installed my entire Steam library of games I bought in anticipation of building a gaming PC from the past couple of years. They all run great! If you enjoy online shooters like CS GO and Team Fortress this laptop is gonna work out great for ya. There are a couple of draw backs. The laptop can get pretty hot sometimes on longer sessions. The speakers are really quite and placed in an awkward area. And, my biggest gripe is the battery life, it just doesn't seem to hold up more than a few hours. So I would imagine that gaming on the go could get a little frustrating if you find yourself too far away from an outlet. Other than that I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a bargain on a machine that will allow them to access the huge array of games available to PC gamers.","2"

"B004G603E2","CM Storm SF-19 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad with Two 140mm Turbine Fans (SGA-4000-KKNF1)","4","2015-05-19","Powerful and effective","A decent cooling pad if you have a laptop that generates a lot of heat. I got this for use with my new 14&#34; Razer Blade. The pad is of course bigger than necessary for such a small laptop, but I wanted the higher fan speed and big fans with lots of airflow that this pad offers. It definitely does make a significant difference on external temperatures when gaming (haven't bothered to monitor internal temps but obviously it helps at least a small amount). The biggest drawback I have noticed is that there is some very noticeable vibration when the fans are used at higher speeds; I think that either the fans themselves or the plastic plate they attach to are rattling against the rest of the pad. It makes it louder (though still not awful) and can be felt through my laptop, so it seems significant enough that I would have expected the product designers to have remedied this issue. Also, the fact that the mesh surface your laptop sits on is not flat (it has a raised perimeter to make the pad look more &#34;gamey&#34;) is just stupid, and while it has not caused a problem for me, I could see it potentially reducing traction for some laptops or making them less stable. Overall, it is still a good cooling pad that will definitely help keep your laptop cool to protect hardware and prevent roasting of your wasd fingers.","0"

I am a computer scientist so I am always on my computer, I've had this machine for two months and so far it has run flawlessly.  The mouse pad is exceptional.  The display is great.  The keyboard lighting is nice.  I got the version with the SSD so start up time is about 5 seconds tops.  Gets somewhere in between warm/hot (to be expected with the GEFORCE graphics card) when gaming but stays for the most part silent.  Nothing so far has gone wrong but I will come back and add to the review if it does.  EDIT: The first slightly annoying aspect of the computer is the aluminum top on the computer.  I have it in my backpack a lot and notebooks are also in the backpack.  When the spirals from the notebook even slightly drag over the finish on the top of the laptop, the black surface is scratched, I haven't found a way to get them out.","0"

Great ASUS Support Team: The problem i had once received it is that the fan made an Extremely noisy sound so i had 2 options here either to send it back to amazon or check the ASUS support. But since i left US in the same day of purchasing the only option left for me is to contact ASUS Support in Dubai. Thanks for the international warranty that saved my investment :) The Asus Support team in Dubai fixed it in 2 days which is a great speed and i was so happy with that. Further more they said for next time they can pick it up and deliver back themselves for free. That was an amazing service.  Studies shows 80% of customers leave a brand after 1 bad customer experience and ASUS here delivered customer service experience with high standard and they won my trust and loyalty  Bottom line i am so happy with my purchase and i did the right decision in terms of budget and performance! i advise you to do the same plus get the 850 Samsung SSD to get the full benefits of its power.

However there are always some downsides I've noticed that with some games it can get overheated and freeze up but, it works fine with games like skyrim and Minecraft.  Another downside is the battery life.  The only thing I don't like about this computer is the terrible battery life.  in the discription it says it has a battery life of 4 hours, this is only if your lucky and you have all of the graphics and brightness turned all the way down.  If you have everything turned up to max you might get an hour and a half tops.  luckily the power cord can be rolled up and can be pretty compact so carrying the power cord is not a problem.  overall this is a very great computer for the price and I recommend it.","2"

I tried a couple of games with gta 5 being the most demanding one, all ran smoothly on at least high settings. Let's be honest - for ultra you'd probably need a machine for at least twice as much. Pros: -probably the best value you could get for that money (there's another option with G 970m 3gb and 8gb ram, rest equal but can't remember the brand. It's not a widely known one though). That alone is 5 stars for me. - doesn't heat up much - looks sleek but I guess it's a more subjective thing - comes with a mouse - quiet  Cons : - it catches fingerprints everywhere easily - ips fhd should be an upgrade but I still feel it's not good enough. It just doesn't look that good plus display is pretty dark even with brightness maxed out in my opinion - all USB ports are located toward the front edge which makes you either drag mouse cord all the way around or just stacked between laptop and mouse itself. It feels inconvenient for me. - the mouse isn't that good  Overall: is it good for gaming ? Yes. Is it worth its price? Most definitely! Is it a high-end gaming laptop?  Absolutely not. 4stars","2"

First off, to add RAM to this machine, you need to take it to a technician unless you're comfortable removing lots of screws, ribbon connectors, and the motherboard.    If you're still thinking of buying this POS, consider the design (or complete lack thereof).  Think circa 1970s USSR.  Battery is hardwired, wrapped in aluminum foil, and not replaceable.  Very much a throwaway laptop, with absolutely nothing accessible by anyone who doesn't build computers (and even then, you need hands smaller than Donald Trump to close this thing back up).  Also, if you buy the 17 inch version of this laptop, DO NOT pick it up with one hand.  Ever.  The thin plastic case is too flimsy to support the weight of the laptop when it is held from only one side.  Pick it up on the left side  and you risk breaking the DVD drawer.  Pick it up on the right side and you risk damaging the hard drive   or even worse, cracking the unbelievably thin motherboard.  So treat this thing like it is made of egg shells and use two hands whenever you move it, and then go back to get your coffee, because if you ever grab it with one hand and hear a faint cracking sound, you'll learn first hand what I mean.  The case on this thing is design suicide, pure and simple.  I strongly suspect the mechanical engineer who designed the case is not getting a Christmas bonus.  So protect yourself from his or her idiocy and always use two hands (or put something stiff underneath it) before you move this laptop.  No exceptions.   In short, this laptop looked very good on paper but proved unusable for me in just over a year.  Easily the most disappointing personal laptop I've ever owned.  So it's back to my lower performing but reliable Fujitsu....  Lastly,  I never experienced the overheating issues that many others have, I think because I downloaded the NVIDIA drivers directly from the NVIDIA website, not the Acer updates.  Video performance improved, and heat was never an issue for me.  So if you still want to take your chances with this thrown-together mishmash of parts, use NVIDIA OEM drivers if you're rendering video or playing demanding games.  Oh, and don't say I didn't warn you....  Happy Holidays to everyone except the ones who designed this laptop.","6"

"B00SIJGRJ8","Alienware 17 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop","4","2015-04-28","Great Game Laptop, poor speakers.","Got my 17 R2 yesterday and have been enjoying setting it up.  I first dumped the platter HD to a new M.2 512Gig hard drive to give the machine more in terms of HD performance.  They should provide an option for this HD setup first, then add platters later.  Dell often doesn't get the enthusiast market very well.  But they do make machines nicely future proof, and this is a good example.  A total of 5 HDs could be installed here.  5!  That's amazing.  Plus the external video setup so future games won't bring the video card to it's knees.  Though the 980 will probably stand the test of time extremely well.  My last Alienware M17x R2 lasted over 6 years, and I didn't have the top of the line video in it.  So I'd expect this new 17 to really take a beating and keep going.  Pros: - It's Alienware :) - 5 HD bays - Included software is nice without over-kill (no other crapware other than Alienware tools!) - Very configurable - Quiet, even under load.  Fans do spin up but with lower frequency making it more tolerable. - Beautiful screen (though I'd rather see 16x10) - SB sound chip does have good features, and does pump out on headphones. - Killer WiFi does push data faster than I've experienced. - Lights are fun! - USB 3.0 only, I've always hated 2.0 and 3.0 mixed ports.  Cons - Sound.  This is the reason for -1 star.  The speakers were a real let down.  More later... - Bad out of the box HD configuration. - Light behind power button is WAY too bright.  Should be configurable, but I've not been able to do that yet with the tools. - Front edge is sharp, making long use painful on wrists. - Touchpad is a bit small for this size of a machine.  Overall, I'm just as pleased as I was with my first Alienware laptop.  The poor sound of the Klipsh speakers was a major let down.  I've owned Klipsh speakers and enjoyed them a lot.  These were really lackluster.  No bass, and 1/2 the output I expected.  It has a sub, and even vibrates pretty badly at volume, but you just can't hear itfor what it's worth.  On the HD setup, I knew about it before purchase so I can't bash it too bad.  It's just you'd think Alienware (Dell) would know this setup is very pedestrian in use, and needs better consideration for it's intended audience.  For the price of the two HDs included, they could have gone full SSD of a much larger size on a single drive.  And, I've always been critical of Alienware's sharp edges.  They look good, but in long term use they can dig into the skin if you lean on the edges too long.  I was surprised find a very nice audio creation app included with the machine.  Call Stagelight, it's more adapted for styles like Dubstep or Pop music, but you could really make some great music with this nice app.  Very well appointed with Midi features too so you can plug in your favorite controller and jam away.  Other pluses on the sound side are the SB software easily adapted to my devices/headphones/mics as I plugged them in to test.  Even recognizing a set of iPhone earbuds as a &#34;phone headset and mic&#34; immediately after plugging in.  There was no shortage of sound power via the jacks.  Still shocked at the internal speakers though.  The keyboard is as good as you can get on a laptop today.  Alienware still uses the traditional key shapes, which I find easier to use.  Chicklet keys are getting better, but still look cheap so I'm glad Alienware hasn't gone there yet.  And, I'm going to really enjoy the Macro keys.  Too bad the 4 macro keys above the numberpad don't use the same lighting as the one's on the side.  My opinion is critical, but I'm still enjoying the machine a lot.  My software tests so far have shown this machine is ready for any game at full graphical settings.  Far Cry 4, and Assassin's Creed Unity both handled full settings with no drastic slowdowns.  The screen is very nice, and I'm glad to finally have an Alienware without the nasty reflective surface.  I do wish this unit had the old 16x10 screen.  16x9 is great for TVs and movies, but for gaming it really sucks.  Plus editing video is harder on 16x9 than it is on 16x10 where you can have controls on the screen that don't block the video.  I was in a quandary on this machine over an ASUS 751 with similar setup.  But the port layout and 980 over 970 video pushed me toward the Alienware.  I won't miss the optical drive, haven't used them in years.  Plus the Alienware attention to other details can't be missed.

The speakers of this system work quite well and are nice and loud.

The 2nd laptop came with the same defect. All keys are OK, but W is sticky. Not sure how Asus tries to position it as a &#34;gaming laptop&#34; when one of the most important keys is broken. Not sure what to do next... return probably. Also, the laptop comes with lots of crapware including one known &#34;antivirus&#34;...

This laptop is powerful enough for graphiics, video, games, Virtualization applications.  I installed VMware Workstation 11 on it and building my vSphere lab.  The 17.3 inch display is bright, sharp, beautiful.  I need to purchase a Bluray player to watch bluray movies on it.  In addition to the built in 512 GB SSD and 1TB HD, additional storage can come in the form of an SD card you click into the SD card reader (flushed to the side of the laptop-very nice).  I have an extra 256 GB SD card but I believe you can now get them in 512 GB. I have owned HP, DELL, Toshiba, Sony, CyberpowerPC, and Panasonic laptops but this ASUS ROG G571 looks and feels the best constructed laptop (not in regards to being rugged like a Panasonic Toughbook) in my honest opinion.  The fans are fairly quiet.  It didn't get warm after using it for 4 hours on my lap.  The sound quality of its speakers is standard for a laptop.  The built in camera and mic were excellent with Skype.  I will have to invest on a good computer bag or backpack to keep it safe.  It is big with a full keyboard and a 17.3 inch display so it is heavier than most laptops.  I am very pleased with this laptop an will buy future generations of ASUS ROG laptops.","1"

Just shy of a month later the numpad keys started to fall off if pressed in the top right corner. The other reason why I give this system such a low rating is because the GPU is throttled at 74c by default. I had to install the latest beta bios that increased the throttling to 81c. That may not seem like much in temperature but it is a huge jump in performance. Some games such as FFXIV went from 720p 40-60fps after 15 minutes of play to solid 60 fps at 1080p. Grand Theft Auto 5 also had a HUGE jump in FPS!!!<br /><br />I got this laptop for gaming and for school and I wasn't willing to take risks so I ended up getting a Macbook Pro 2015 retina laptop instead and it actually feels like a premium laptop I was desiring.","0"

I would say it immediately crashed and rebooted but that would imply that it didn't take 10 minutes to boot up, but it did, after a reboot for a driver failure out of the box, I got it working and enjoyed the truly beautiful screen and great sound quality of this device.  I went from Windows XP to 8.1 and that is a challenging learning curve but the laptop's fault, but that's my issue.  I am sending the laptop back to Lenovo (I want very much to keep this computer I just want it to work) because in the 2 days I have had this laptop I have had 8 bluescreens and I'm not doing anything on it currently but checking emails and surfing the web (I got nervous after the first system crash that I would have to reinstall windows so I never put any games or movies on it.)  The last bluescreen left my computer unable to boot up Windows.  I called Lenovo and spoke with a very nice rep there who was beyond helpful and I will be sending this in for repairs.  If this happens to you, make sure you ask them to send you the shipping box for returning the computer, they tried to send me 30 miles away to a FedEx store instead of just mailing me a shipping box.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-screen is beautiful and enormous, at full brightness the color is mind blowing<br />-the touch screen is sensitive and responsive, knows exactly where you clicked<br />-customer support was excellent<br />-sound is amazing for a laptop<br />-laptop looks great, black and red, it is sleek and mean; suitable for work and play situations<br />-facial rec is pretty cool<br />-comes with an external optical drive. I was disappointed that it was external, never owned an external before, but I really love it not being in the computer adding to the weight and taking up space.  This was one of the biggest reasons I got this laptop, because it was included and I didn't already own one.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-the keyboard feels very odd, its compacted it feels like.  I have big hands so it is hard to hit some of the keys without pressing two other buttons.  Especial for a 17&#34; laptop, this thing has nothing but space for keys and they decide to cram it into a space smaller that my 15&#34; laptop's keyboard<br />-the boot up time on this thing is so slow, I hope that's just with my buggy Windows image<br />-the screen is like a mirror, if you play dark games or movies in &#34;brightly lit rooms&#34; as in a room with any light get used to looking at yourself.  If you jack up the brightness of the screen and play brighter images, this is almost unnoticeable.<br />-Windows 8.1 is awful not this computer's fault, just wanted to say that.  it's made for touch screens but the features miss the mark at times.  randomly switching screens because I moved my hand, closing windows, scroll bar spazing out<br />-the obvious, a new computer should not have fatal errors with the Window's image and hard drives like this<br />-holy add-ons Batman, this thing is loaded... with junk.  I was so happy to hear that Windows 10 would allow for a fresh install, because this laptop needs an enema with all the crap they have put in it.  Good news is that because of the add-ons, you get 6 months free antivirus because of the superfish lawsuit.<br /><br />I wish I could review the tech specs of the laptop, but unfortunately I can't play a single game without the computer bluescreening.<br /><br />I really hope that Lenovo fixes this issue, all I have ever owned are HPs or Lenovos and I have always been more or less pleased with their products; the Lenovo y70 just won out over the HP Omen when I bought it and I am starting to regret it.  If this thing comes back from Texas and doesn't bluescreen, I will give it 4 stars all day long (I can't bring myself to do five because it should have done it out of the box) but until then, I give it a generous 2 stars.","3"

I love the speakers they sounds better than my laptop speakers which I thought were sufficient until I heard these. It is ultra quite, I don't even hear it at all. I have to look at the fan to see if it is running, good thing they put the light there. I has kept my laptop cooler too, which was the whole point of buying it. The incline makes a good angle for typing, it is more comfortable than having the laptop flat, don't know if the intended this benefit but it is nice. Over all I am happy with this purchase.

NO, they could not. I wanted to give this high marks but there are so many flaws it's really average as a powerful computer. The MacAfee anti-virus that dramatically slows down disk performance to the point I can't believe it's a gaming PC. Very messy, complex audio configuration so elaborate that just inserting headphone jacks won't give you any audio until you muddle through a messy configuration and preferences wizard. Tons of nags to use Asus cloud disk storage, get Microsoft office &#34;before it's too late,&#34; and on and on and on. This is hands down THE MOST ANNOYING PC experience I've ever encountered. And then, it prompted me to upgrade the firmware and that destroyed the SSD's firmware. I've been doing firmware updates on systems for more years than I'll admit and this is the first manufacturer's prompted update that bricked a device. Asus customer service was absolutely first rate in fixing it - fast call, free shipping there and back, one week turnaround (I live in CA, their service center was 1 shipping day away from me even with their free economy return label). But come on guys, it's your own firmware update wizard! The red key illumination gimic would be ok if the keys were actually legible in less than total darkness, but when the room anywhere between &#34;office bright&#34; and pitch black the keys are extremely difficult to read because the black key faces and extremely dim red LED illumination results in a black-on-black key faces. I'm a touch typist but this weird left of center trackpad throws me off  -I work on several other computers. I guess if these was my only PC it might grow on me. But there are all the macro keys that I accidentally hit when I'm in hurry and it fires up all this full screen crapware that just makes matters worse by slowing me down. It does have a great screen and the box it comes in is like a suitcase so I use it to carry it around for demos and to/from the office. I work in a game development studio and we bought a bunch of these, sort of our standard platform for certain activities. There is also a quirk with all of these we've purchased where you can't get the screen to come on when it wakes from sleep so you have to keep opening and closing the lid until on the 3rd or 4th try the screen finally works. If this is a configuration detail it's a bug and has happened consistently on the last 4 of these systems we've purchased, even after completely wiping Windows and doing a fresh install. Overall, this PC does not suck, but all the shovelware and gimics ruin what would otherwise be a much better laptop, and a fresh Windows install solves some of that but those damn dim red keys are here to stay.ase so I use it to carry it around for demos and to/from the office.

"B00IAACXMU","ASUS ROG  17.3-inch Gaming Laptop, GeForce GTX 880M Graphics","5","2015-05-04","Powerful and sturdy","After using this rig for five months' worth of gaming and hacking, I heartily endorse it. It's delivered on the major items I was hoping for: performance, reliability, and sturdiness.<br /><br />The most demanding game I use it for is Mass Effect 3, on which it doesn't even break a sweat with all graphics performance settings maxed out, and I play online pretty frequently. The only caveat is that NVidia's most current driver (as of 5/4/2015) broke Mass Effect 3 badly -- I had to re-install the previous version (347.88), which fixed ME3 but was a pain to locate on Nvidia's website. So: don't upgrade to the latest NVidia drivers before other people have had a couple of weeks to report issues like this.Not that this has anything to do with Asus.<br /><br />The hacking I referred to is (legitimate) security research and penetration-testing practice, which involves lots of VMWare sessions consisting of Linux guests attacking other guest systems running various other operating systems (usually 3 or 4 concurrent virtual machines total). This system handles concurrent virtual machine guest sessions quite well, and the hardware is all nicely compatible with VMWare. (Naturally, you have to give some thought to memory allocation when setting up guest VMs.)<br /><br />Lastly, while this machine is quite heavy, that's largely due to how solidly it's built. It's got a very rigid case -- it doesn't want to flex across the diagonals when you pick it up hastily, like nearly every other laptop I've owned. I sort of agree with those who criticize the AC adapter input design -- the cord seems to want to pop out sometimes. However, I still think it's an elegant design: popping out is better than cracking the socket! And I find the AC connector's placement less intrusive than the USB ports on the right-hand side, which can interfere with mousing (if it were me, I'd have stuck them on the back). None of that bothers me much, though.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this machine!","1"

I was truly disappointed at first because the game at the highest settings (4k, high everything) was not able to run. Following that disappointment, i then put it in 1080 with all settings still high and it still didnt run! I was really debating whether i should return the laptop at that point, but then i installed a lot of drivers from support.dell.com and holy crap, it actually worked!!!!!!! I guess out of the box the alienware is slow, but after installing all the drivers, it's like i finally have the alienware that imagined it would be.

Anyway, just download the current drives and you'll be fine :).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-alienware prestige ;)<br />-sturdy and great build; i feel like i could drop it and it wont break<br />-IPS and 4k are so sexy<br />-graphics are great<br />-it's an alienware<br />-touchscreen is responsive<br /><br />Cons:<br />-it doesnt make food for me<br />-the keyboard feels cheap?

Google it, it's actually quite easy to do.<br /><br />Only real issue with this laptop is the battery life is only about 2 hours on a good day, but it doesn't bother me because I bought this to be a mobile work station rather than a netbook that has 10+ hours of battery life. This thing is a sweet powerhouse.<br /><br />On the plus side, though, I am extremely, extremely happy with this laptop.

The on board graphics allows for good gaming performance and the SSD allows for lightning fast boot up. I have tried some games out on Ultra settings(Rome II, endless space) and the game has been able to handle it very well. Also note that the HDD has a speed of 7200RPM and it seems to have noticeably better R/W speeds than 5400RPM HDD's(My old laptop had 5400). One more thing to note is that the on board battery life is quite good as I was able to get a solid 4-5 hours on light usage.<br />However, the onboard track pad is positively possessed; after using this laptop for close to a month I am convinced that this is just a horrible design. It is very hard to scroll using it and loves to switch tabs when using it by taking you to the bottom corner of the screens thereby switching tabs. Another note is that the matte finish while nice is extremely very susceptive to scratches. It is very disheartening to see this brand new laptop get scratches all over it simply from daily school usage. It looks like the layer on top of the aluminum is very light and therefore even the slightest scratches look ghastly upon it. On a final note, the letters on the  keyboard can be somewhat hard to read in low light conditions although it does not take anything away from the feel of it. The key travel is excellent and the additional num-pad is also nice to use.","0"

"B00UOYQ0YW","ASUS G501JW 15-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","5","2015-06-23","Awesome Machine","Great Computer! I bought this computer for my freshmen year in college, it is a bit overkill for taking notes and completing assignments.  Anyway this computer is lightning fast, relatively light for what you get. While gaming the fans do make noise, but if you have any type of other ambient noise such as a speaker system while playing a game the fans become completely silent.  As far as the screen goes I haven't run into any game changing issues yet, I do have to admit the scaling on some older applications and install windows sometimes come out to be really tiny, but you can figit your settings to have the windows appear bigger and still run in 4k.  The screens colors are very dark and in depth, not like the whitewashed out colors many laptops produce.  Some games can be playable on 4k, as long as you don't mind the occasional lag, nothing serious though, unless you take settings up to ultra levels. The laptop does a great job at keeping cool, and directing heat away from contact points.  While gaming the entire keyboard will stay about room temperature, and only the bezel above the keyboard gets hot, and I mean hot. The computer also dissipates a fair amount of heat through the aluminum bottom, and would benefit greatly from a cooling pad.  The overall build of the computer is fantastic, the keyboard feels good to use and all the contact points are user friendly.  The trackpad click is a bit stiff though, and gesture take two tries at times.  I would reccomend this computer for anyone looking for an extremely portable gaming computer, and i have to note the battery life on this computer will be greater than a lot of other gaming computers.  I enjoy using this computer, and it has yet to have any huge issues. I'm happy.","2"

When I did some researching for just a gaming Laptop to attend my needs in the latest gaming with up to date powerful graphic card and Processor. Asus was the one with its reputation for gaming and has been known for a long time in building a monster gaming pc.  I decided to purchase a portable gaming laptop, Why?, well it saves up space on my desk, you can take it anywhere on the go, and this one comes with a the latest Geforce GTX 980 graphic card.  I received this through USP shipping via Prime which of course gives you two day shipping. Although i was confused, when i order it on a thursday and didn't get the package until the following monday.  It turns out it is only two business day shipping. So much for fast shipping. It comes in another cardboard box when shipped and inside that cardboard box is the case box with the gaming notebook.  I was very excited and anxious to try out this new laptop and i am very pleased on its performance and capabilities.  I only had less than a week and will update more later in the future.  It is quite heavy as they said in their youtube reviews, but i'm find with it.  I like to think of it as a strong durable laptop that will last long.  I like that it came with a microfiber cloth to help clean off dust, but beware of those greasy or sweating hands that can leave a print on the outer case.  The laptop is amazing with its 1080p resolution, and perfect for movies, games, just about anything you can see.  I like that it super quiet when gaming except you can hear the dual fans working, but thats normal, since this is a powerful gaming laptop.  One thing i didn't like is that it didn't come with a OS CD or Recovery CD.  Not sure if most computer company don't included them, but i thought it would be important to have one just incase you have to restart windows again. This is my first gaming laptop and i am very please with its performance.","1"
"B00S5SM9BW","MSI GT80 TITAN SLI-001 18.4-Inch Gaming Laptop","5","2015-06-27","This thing is a beast.","Where to start...I had an ASUS Republic of Gamers before this, cant remember the model, but it had a 700m something series nvidia video card and it was moderately powerful until the next gen (which is now the current gen) consoles and games came out, that's when I decided I needed to get something better and not just a little better, something that would last at least as long as a consoles generation.  Enter the MSI GT80 Titan. I'll give 3 examples/comparison, The Witcher 3 on my ASUS, even with the all graphics settings set to low, the movement was kinda choppy, not real fluid and smooth.  I didn't really realize this until I got the Titan.  I installed Witcher 3, put the settings to Ultra, and laughed at how much better the game looked, and played.  Star Citizen, although still in early Alpha, is very graphically demanding.  On my ASUS, not only did I have to put the graphics to low, but I had to drop the resolution from  1920 x 1080 to like 1300 something, at least like 4 notches down.  Once again, the Titan plays it on ultra beautifully, AND at 1920 x 1080 res.  Last is Assassin's Creed Unity, and for a reason.  My ASUS could barely run it, the Titan it runs at Ultra almost flawlessly. The only downfall is, the fans kick in really quick and stay stay on which gets pretty loud.  The game is very graphically demanding and I also think it wasn't optimized very well.  That's really the only game so far that the fans really have to work overtime and get loud, so it doesn't bother me at all, especially since I stopped playing AC Unity because it blows hard, not unlike the fans.<br />The screen is 18.3 inches which is less than 3 inches smaller than my MAC desktop.  The mechanical keyboard is amazing,  Depending on how you buy it, it comes with a pretty sweet MSI laptop backpack, and a wrist rest,  which I wasn't even expecting so that was a nice surprise.  On top of all of this, when the 2 GTX 980M video cards start to really seem out of date I can upgrade, which mostlaptops do not offer.<br />I absolutely love this thing, I was sick of compromising for certain things, do i want to spend a little less money and get this, but it doesn't offer this, but this one is better at doing this but costs a little more blah blah blah... I just wanted something that played everything.  Even though there is one model that is a little bit better than this one, I got this at a very good reduced price and I couldn't say no, and having done that, I could care less that there is on model higher.  This satisfies all my nerdy geeky gaming needs.  As a pretty hardcore gamer, I am finally satisfied.","2"

I definitely like the form factor. For a gaming laptop, it's not garish like the others you usually find. The build quality of the product looks to be top-notch. Things feel very solid, no cheap feeling parts. The keyboard, despite being on a 15-inch laptop, doesn't feel cramped for the most part (the arrow keys could be larger but it's not so horrible that you can't use them).  Unfortunately, a computer is only as good as its weakest component and it seems I was &#34;lucky&#34; enough to get one that either had a borked hard drive or the general quality of the hard drive is very poor. It's a WD Blue that runs at 5400 RPM, which on the grand scale of things isn't the best in the world by a long-shot but the performance I was getting was atrocious. It literally couldn't handle writing files to disk while downloading and the whole system would get locked up because the disk usage would be at 99% while writing 10MB/s (keep in mind that this hard drive is supposed to be able to write 100 MB/s easily). The disk usage would jump to 100% while just opening Skype, which would basically make the computer unusable until it the program finishes opening (ironic, considering there's a nice sticker on it saying &#34;SKYPE CERTIFIED&#34;. It can't even run the desktop application properly). For the first time in my life, I saw Steam stop downloading a game because the computer was too busy trying to write files to a disk.  I have a 6 year old Dell laptop (Yes, 6 years old. It has a Core 2 duo processor. This thing has a fourth gen i7) that has a Seagate 5400RPM hard drive that runs way better than this laptop.  The listed components are impressive and all (a 4th gen i7 with a 960M is nothing to laugh at) but when the included hard drive makes it worse than a 6 year old laptop, there are some serious problems.  I will be returning this laptop and looking elsewhere. I'm incredibly disappointed with this product.","21"

I work from home and needed a computer that could do it all, while being portable. My current set up consist of a universal docking station (UDS) that I use to run my dual monitor set up from the laptop as well as wireless keyboard and mouse. I also have 3 external hard drives connected through the UDS. In order to get maximum performance out of this machine, I purchased a 500 GB SSD to swap with the 1 TB drive. This conversion was simple and did not require much effort. The 1 TB drive is easily accessible via the bottom removable cover.<br /><br />The computer is fast, once the power button is pressed, you will see the welcome screen. The processing speed is adequate and allows me to run multiple programs at once (ie: Indesign, Illustrator, Premiere & Dreamweaver). The 2GB GTX 960m does the job. When editing videos, I can playback in full res from the preview monitor. There are no hangups when working in the programs, providing me an efficient work flow.<br /><br />If you are in the market for an affordable laptop that will give you the increased performance you need for graphic design and video editing, I'd suggest you take a serious look at this ASUS ROG GL55.","4"

It delivers a nice chill but it only cooled the outside of my MSI GT80 Titan SLI-001 gaming laptop. I gamed for about 45 minutes using the CM SF-19 playing Call of Duty Advanced Warfare on max settings. GPU and CPU temps rose and remained steady just as it did prior to using the CM SF-19. I returned it the same day it was delivered. Don't know why I felt I needed it but I found out prior to buying the CM SF-19 that the MSI GT80 Titan SLI-001 has an internal fan boost with heat sink that will dissipate the heat automatically and bring the temps down without having to use the manual fan boost. I guess seeing the temps rise into the 60's and 70's made me worry but I also found out that these temps are normal range when gaming on the MSI Titan.  I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS A BAD PRODUCT. IT'S NOT A GOOD DESIGN FOR MY PC'S DESIGN. One other note. One of the fans makes a strange noise when fully maxed using the manual control. Good day. :)","1"

I have tuned the maximum processor frequency to 99%, disabling  turbo boost agree updating to the newest bios. I am also using an antec laptop cooler.<br /><br />In all games I am currently running my cpu cores and gpu run concurrently around 80 consistently. This is at 1080p using the 1tb hdd option machine. This is acceptable heat vs power performance, the key to running a long term rig is to not cook it to death. I suspect with moderate use this laptop will last 3 years before issues pop up.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Beautiful screen<br />Excellent cooling, see above. This is for 3-4 hour sessions,  cpu and gpu both perform brilliantly<br />Nice looking keyboard, acceptable performance but if you are using it on a desk get an external keyboard.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fingerprint magnet. I'm naturally oily, this laptop looks horrible after a session. Should have included a microfiber cloth.<br /><br />Hard drive speed- the hgst drive that came included with my laptop simply had unacceptable performance. I installed my old sata ssd and the unit works as it should. For a 1050 dollar laptop (and with current pricing) asus should have accepted a slight profit loss and installed a ssd in the first place.<br /><br />Software load. Way too much crapware on the initial install. As I replaced the hdd and I'm a technician it was a breeze reinstalling the os, but for the price point this should not have been an issue.<br /><br />Final note: this unit has a single user accessible sata port unless you replace your optical with an adapter. There probably is a msata port somewhere but I'm not going to void my warranty to find it.<br /><br />4/5, only 4 because of the cons listed","0"

Within two weeks of owning this it fell out of my accidentally unzipped bag, and it fell three feet or so right onto its side edge.  There is a slight ripple in the frame and one function key is slightly askew, but it otherwise took the punch and has been running like a champ with no issues.

Unfortunately after not using it for about a month due to the fact that I had nowhere to put it, it started to make a weird sound that was very noticeable and when I lifted my laptop I could see that the fan on the right was not spinning correctly and after maybe 30 minutes of use the fan completely stopped working. The left still runs just fine with no noise except that of the air it is pushing. I will continue to use it until I find a much better replacement.

I'm not too thrilled with the speakers as the sound seems like its coming from under water. It's got a deep mids. For a gaming PC, you might want to put on headphones so Ill try that and hope that it's better. The overall speed from the 128gb SSD is great. Another thing to watch out for is the graphics card. It used the Intel HD built in GPU instead of the 960m by default.  For anyone interested in Cortana's features for Windows 10, you have to adjust the mic settings in order for her to hear you. She kind of understands what you're saying as long as you're very close to the mic if you dont make any changes but it really makes a difference if you adjust the mic. For an everyday computer, it's lightweight so it's very easy to transport.   Games are ok, no issues so far. It does heat up fast but thats expected. The battery lasts around an hour and a half with reduced power settings. Windows 10 might have something to do with it.","0"

The 140mm fan can go from 800rpm to 1300rpm while maintaining silent operation and good airflow. Rubber feet on the surface of the cooler to prevent the laptop from sliding and a very ingenious design to integrate the fan and speaker switches on the side of the speakers. One or two USB can power the device and it have a USB pass through, a single on/off switch for the fan led.<br /><br />Speaker: What a surprise! It completely blow my laptop speakers out of the water and any integrated speaker that comes with a laptop. The sound is surprisingly balanced and distortion free, even at higher volume. Vocal and movie dialog can be easily heard, just the right amount of mid bass and slight treble roll off for such a small 3 inch driver. The stereo separation is passable, but is only due to the side firing nature of the drivers. Did I mention it gets LOUD!<br /><br />Overall one of the best engineered laptop cooler speaker combo device. If you need a laptop cooler and a much need speaker upgrade. This is the best option in the market and priced very competitively.","2"

But what really sells it is the companies dedication to solid performance and great customer service.  It's something that's rare these days.  This company is an open book as far as policies and technology.<br /><br />The Pro's:<br />GREAT construction - very nice finishes, keyboard and track pad are the best I've used<br />The most upgradable laptop available - 4 hard drive slots, 4 ram slots, a few screws to access all the inner workings<br />Beautiful Screen - Love the IPS and matte finish<br /><br />GTX 970m - Plays games like a champ<br />The Con's:<br />No G-Sync (I'm sure they'll have it sooner or later)<br />Not the thinnest or lightest laptop (but it's a trade off for the price and expandability)<br /><br />This company is going to blow up.  They aren't going to be the next apple, but they are providing a product few can rival. Making high performance SSD's and RAM that are specifically made for their laptops is something no one else is doing.

The middle button does nothing. I've taken to leaving the machine running for days at a time and disabling all power saving features since it's a 50/50 crapshoot whether or not it will start up again. I love Windows gaming, but it may be time to move on and give it up since all &#34;high performance&#34; machines are nothing but trouble--partially, I suspect, because Microsoft Windows is so terrible.  Updating again because the laptop has started working again, though when it &#34;chokes&#34; there is no way to restart it other than letting the battery run out and then plugging it back in again. The &#34;reset&#34; button does nothing, and the battery is inside the machine so it can't just be yanked out and put back in. Overall, a great laptop for gaming but the issue of it hanging and being unable to reboot it is troublesome. Note that I don't have any exotic software on the machine: Windows 10 with all the updates, Steam and my Steam games. That's pretty much it.  I'm updating this review because four months after purchase the machine started having issues. I was unable to power it off other than letting the battery run out. I emailed support and they took more than a full week to respond to my initial email.  Ultimately I was able to shut the laptop down from the command line but figured this out on my own. Today the QHD is DOA. I turned it on and e fans and keyboard work but the screen is blank and the power button won't work. I'm letting the battery run out again to shut off the machine and emailed tech support but I get the feeling it's going to be at least a month before I'm able to use the machine again given Razers slow tech support.  ---  This WAS a fantastic laptop that plays any game I can throw at it. The screen is a bit small, but I travel so it's perfect forthe road and the HDMI adapter lets me use a big screen TV as a monitor so the small monitor isn't that big a deal.  The laptop itself is very compact. Windows 10 seems to have fixed all of the horrible things with Windows 8.1.  I'm knocking this down one star from five because, when travelling and plugging this laptop into the AC adapters on airplanes, the battery discharges faster than the adapter can charge it. This means, on a long flight, I can play a game for about 90 minutes and then have to let the laptop charge for two hours before getting another 90 minutes.  If you're not going to use it on a plane for gaming, it's still a fantastic laptop and I still love it at home (or in a hotel) where the AC power is strong enough so I don't have that issue.","0"

With the great experience I had with that I decided to check out the latest and greatest from ASUS. All the laptop review sites I looked at had this as their best buy recommendation, best graphical power for your buck. There's another tier of these with one generation newer graphic card but I didn't want to spend the extra 500-700 for that.<br /><br />Arrived as described by seller, brand new, nicely packaged to avoid any possible damage. Opened it up, plugged it in and it was good to go. I've seen some of the other reviewers post their FPS and stats for gaming so I won't go into detail on that. But let me tell you, those minecraft pixels have never looked so good! (bad joke, I know). All I'll tell you is that it works great. Keyboard is a little bit nicer than my old G50, always had some issues with typing on that one. Little bit thinner and lighter than the older model as well. I've noticed some people saying how quite the fans are and mine are not any quieter than my g50. Still can hear the hum while they're going, but for me that gives me comfort that they are working!<br /><br />No issues so far, played Smite (not graphically intense) and worked beautifully. Looking forward to installing skyrim on this beast and seeing how it works. Would highly recommend ASUS for any computing needs!","0"

"B0105JD1HE","Acer Aspire E5 17.3 Full HD Gaming Laptop","5","2015-08-24","No other word - fantastic.","I have to say, I was amazed by the price of this laptop.  The price has risen since I bought it - I bought it for $569.99 and it was the best bargain I've ever got. This laptop has a GTX 940M which is more powerful than many 2-3 year old GPUs used in desktop towers, which is what I find the most astonishing. Aside from that, it has an i5-5200U and you shouldn't let the U (underclocked) scare you - it still runs many programs without problems. I can easily run CS:GO, Spotify, Firefox, Skype and TeamSpeak at the same time, with no heating issues. This includes over extremely long periods of time. I have had 4-6 hour gaming sessions using this laptop and have had absolutely no issues with the heat - it only goes to 40c (my desktop runs at about that temperature, to give you an idea of how little heat that is). That said, if heat is a worry of yours, purchase a laptop cooler platform for less than $40 and you'll have peace of mind.  I really put it through it's paces yesterday - I ran Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead, grabbed a jet and blew up a ton of stuff in 3rd person to test how much the frames would tank. I was shocked when it didn't. I placed a ton of opposite teamed AI units to fight against each other in carnage - it still pulled a solid 60 FPS on HIGH SETTINGS.  This laptop is fantastic. The only slight downside is that it is NOT 1080p, the max resolution is 1366x768 (so it's still HD, just not 1080p). This flaw (for me) is minor. On the flip-side, the lower resolution is possibly so it can pull more frames in games, which is an upside.  As for *extreme* top-end games on the GPU such as Arma 3, I'm not sure - don't quote me on it. If the laptop's ability to play Arma 2: OA in any way reflects the way it plays Arma 3 or DayZ then I would say yes, but these games are not as optimised and you should be cautious. If you have any doubts, check a benchmarking website for a 940M and the game you want.  EDIT: This laptop will run Fallout 4 on low-medium settings very smoothly. If you're looking to buy it for Fallout 4, then be in safe mind that you can.","2"

I continue to buy Acer because in comparison an Asus or comparable name is often up to 30% more for the same parts!

This is an Alienware - just about every good geek's dream computer - in an affordable laptop package deal.  The price was absolutely ripe for the picking.  I went for it after months of watching the price, deliberating, reading reviews, and quibbling.  So now that I've had it for a couple months?  I LOVE IT.  It runs like greased lightning.  It travels well - I'm a consultant and put on some serious travel miles.  It's a beast.  I could bore you with specs, but there's the low down on that already here from several other reviewers.  Instead, let me say it's the finest computer I've owned since my ancient Atari 1040ST - and that baby stayed in my possession for over 12 yrs, despite being outdated and eclipsed several times over!  You can game with this one.  You can work with this one.  You can practically wash your car with this one - okay, a little exaggeration, but do NOT sue me if you're crazy enough to try it.  I do NOT regret that it only has an i5 - it does the job and does it well.  If you were hesitating on getting this lappy, stop hesitating and take the plunge.  I don't regret it for a second.<br /><br />Note:  I recently upgraded to Win 10.  So far, so good.  Got driver updates and the BIOS update from Dell support website and installed with no issues.  I highly recommend getting those drivers updated immediately if you do upgrade to Win 10 - Sound Blaster Recon3Di won't work without the updated driver (you'll have zero sound).","3"

"B00TI6TASK","MSI GE Series GE70 Apache Pro-681 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop (Aluminum Black)","4","2015-08-29","So far so good","Well, straight up to the point it is a decent gaming laptop, and for 1000 bucks I think it performs pretty good.<br /><br />The laptop has an aluminum brush finish which is a finger print magnet especially if you have sweaty hands and needs some wipes with alcohol to get it clean. But it doesn't bother me at all. The touch pad is mediocre, it's okay to me since I have rather dry fingers, but when your hands are moist those line finished touchpad will catch on your fingers making scrolling a bit of a problem. But again I'm totally fine with that since I use a wireless mouse anyway and an occasional usage of the touch pad is not a big deal to me.<br /><br />The keyboard is a bit funky at first but I got used to it over the last month or so. The lighting options are limited however. The lighting is divided into 3 sections, left center and right and using msi's software I can set the colors and effects to certain modes, but I originally was expecting a full customizability but I guess at least some customizability is ok since most other gaming notebooks around 1000 don't have this kind of color customizability.<br /><br />The main problem with this laptop is heat. Right above the touch pad is the cpu and on the far left side of the keyboard is the fan. Both of these get pretty toasty with gaming, and you would probably want a laptop cooler pad with this.<br /><br />A limit to my selection of hard drive is it's speed. And I feel like I should buy a ssd either 2.5&#34; or a msata drive (yes it supports msata) for a general boot drive if not a cache drive. The hdd is divided into 2 partitions which I don't know why, but I keep my files on the boot drive so I could easily clone my drive wheb the time comes.<br /><br />While playing starcraft 2 on extreme graphic options with nvidia graphics on (which is a bit funky to configure) I got my game's fps dropping to somewhere to ... 0 fps.... well more like 0.5 fps. I don't know whether this was a throttling issue or a hdd speed issue, but that's what happened. Sc2 is fine on high settings and below. Minecraft with SEUS mos (shaders) gave me a fps of around 30 fps on average.<br /><br />When you unplug the system, the laptop perfermance drops sharply. So if you're gaming I would recomend that you always plug the system in... which kind of defeats the purpose of a laptop... a bit... maybe... And battery life is very short. I've seen 2 hours, depending on settings but an average of 3 hrs. I also want to get a bigger battery later on to crank up that battery life because I'm going to be carrying this laptop alot. Maybe a 7200mah battery for an upgrade in the future would be nice. I've tried and seen my laptop die in 2-4 hours while it was sleeping in sleep mode... a slow and quiet death of your laptop...<br /><br />But any modification to the internal hardware will void your currently 2 yrs of the most basic warranty and speaking of a warranty, you need to register your device with in a month of purchasing the product to get your warranty. Otherwise its gone. You can get a replacement battery for an year after activation as well.<br /><br />That's it for now and I'll be back when i do an upgrade. Signed 8/29/2015<br />--<br />So it's been about a month into using this laptop, and yeah, so far so good. It's just as described as before and is working fine so far. I personally don't use this laptop with highly graphics demanding games, but I tested minecraft with sues shaders everything maxed and got around 30 fps on average in creative mode flying around. One thing to note is that I've had issues setting the default graphics settings on the computer, and so I have to open applications like minecraft with my roght click and in graphic options choose high graphic nvidia geforce card or something like that instead of the stock intel hd graphics, which makes minecraft with shaders go around 5 fps if not 0.5 fps with hundreds of blazes spawned...<br /><br />I play starcraft more regularly and that has been going smoothly wven though sometimes its hard on the graphics with the highest settings especially in multiplayer.<br /><br />Battery life is relatively short on this stock battery, but doesn't concern me that much since my university has many outlets available. I've seen upto 3 hours of web surfing with extremely low cpu settings on power saver (limiting the cpu to about 20%) its still usable and works fine with on google docs. Except the internet may go strange with wifi on power saver settings and I've had it disconnect a couple of times when I used the power saving option.<br /><br />Final Update<br />So after using this laptop for a good 6 month I think it's time to finish up the review. Over the course of 6 month, I've had no problems. If I were to say what was good about it, well, it is a pretty dank good laptop for $999. The fourth gen i7 hq processor holds up to its expectations of 3.6ghz, and the 960M does very well as well. The 12gb RAM I can never use completely.<br /><br />The only set down to this computer is the hard drive, it does run at 7000+rpm but is pretty slow compared to all the other components.

I spent quite a bit of time and effort on my own trying to find what was wrong researching it through the internet. Apparently the new drivers for soundcard (realtek) are very poorly written and can result in driver conflicts with other programs.  I also ended up returning the laptop after days of trial and error, but I finally found that if I uninstalled all sound devices and drivers, then let windows use an OLD driver, it worked.  If you see an option to &#34;roll back&#34; the sound driver to an older one, do that...it worked for me.  95% of people would have just given up and returned the computer...but I suspected I would have the same problem if I bought a new one.

Works with Apple 27"" Thunderbolt display.","Time for a review, but first a warning.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS OFF OF AMAZON WAREHOUSE DEALS. At least: that was my experience. The first go around I bought it, &#34;Used, like new&#34; direct from Amazon Warehouse deals. Which basically means item had been opened but apparently unused. That was definitely NOT the case in my experience. Computer had a Windows refurbished sticker on the bottom for activation. &#34;Refurbished&#34; is different than &#34;Used like New&#34;. At first, I was like ok, and proceeded anyways. However once I got into using the computer, loading it with software is when the real issues started. Long story short, what I believed happen, is that somebody ordered this computer previously with the sole purpose of committing fraud. All of the internal high end hardware was missing or did not work. NO Nvidia graphics card, thunderbolt port did not work, storage was not as spec'd...Just a bunch of stuff was wrong.<br /><br />So I called Amazon and explained to them what was going on and to their credit (Amazon has awesome, live customer service) - they refunded my original purchase, set up a return, and allowed me to both order a brand new one, and they picked up overnight shipping.<br /><br />When I got the new one and operated them side by side is when the differences became immediately apparent. The brand new out of box booted directly to Asus' ROG screen (not a big deal because I didn't buy it for gaming anyways) - but just the interface alone told me I had made the right decision to reject and return the Warehouse Deal one.<br /><br />Anyways - this does everything so far that it promises to do. One of my big question marks, which is apparently a lot of peoples' questions on the web, is whether or not this will interface with a 27&#34; Apple Thunderbolt Display.<br /><br />To that I answer a resounding and confident, first-hand experience, &#34;YES&#34;. Plugged it in to the port and it immediately recognized its presence and I use it every day as I do my Macbook Pro.<br /><br />I have only had it a couple days but it runs graphics based software beautifully and without delay. Coming from a Mac interface, there is a learning curve, but I expected as much.","5"

One warning, when Windows 10 is installed, it will render the mousepad useless, and you will need to plug in a mouse. An update must be installed to get the mousepad working again.","0"

Overall, this is a fantastic laptop.  The screen is lovely, the keyboard and touchpad are decent, and the power is unmatched for the price point.  The issue, however, is the cheapest, smallest, yet most important piece of hardware - the wireless card.  I have had issue after issue with this card.  At times I have not been able to load simple web pages on this laptop.  My 6+ year old Lenovo x200 has been running circles around it.

"B0105JD1HE","Acer Aspire E5 17.3 Full HD Gaming Laptop","4","2015-08-14","Excellent Purchase","Overall this laptop is stellar for the price, however there are two drawbacks:  (1) The trackpad/mousepad, moving the cursor around with it isn't particularly terrible, but the left and right buttons are trash. Keep in mind though I have a strong bias towards hating laptop mousepads  (2) This laptop came with a REMARKABLE amount of bloatware, I ran a batch uninstall on 43 programs. 43! This is my first laptop in over 8 years so maybe the markets changed and that's the norm    Overall I recommend this laptop and its a steal at $600, in my opinion. I was wowed by the Realtek wireless adapter and the screen (which is much better than I thought it would be), though overall construction of the screen has a somewhat flimsy feel to it, it doesn't seem particularly firm and if dropped would most likely break (of course, depending on the drop), but it doesn't seem likely to break just due to day to day use. The only reason I paused while buying this is the 8gb SSD, I initially thought that would complicate installing Arch and dual booting that with windows 8.1, however upon further examination (with diskmgmt.msc) it seems as though that 8gb SSD might not actually exist. It may merely be a typo or a blatant lie on the sellers part but I don't particularly care, this is an excellent laptop.  UPDATE: After a day or two of using the mousepad I'm much better at it (I think I just have s***ty hands), at this point I'd just say the mousepad is sub-par, not horrible.","0"

"B00YFE552U","CUK MSI GE62 Apache 15.6-inch i7-5700HQ 16GB 256GB SSD + 2TB HDD NVIDIA GTX 960M 2GB Windows 10 Full HD Gaming Laptop Computer","4","2015-08-15","Nearly Perfect Gaming Laptop","Laptop rating: 4.5/5<br />CUK Customer Support: 5/5<br /><br />First off, let me just say CUK's Customer Support was quick and responded to my issue with speed and with a good attitude the entire time. When we ordered the systems, they initially shipped with only 12 GB memory when we had ordered 16 GB. Clarance at CUK was a great help both on the phone and through email, with getting the problem resolved. Rather than having to ship the systems back for repair, he shipped us the memory and we swapped it out ourselves and returned the replaced memory.<br /><br />On to the laptop review. This is an overall great gaming laptop. The initial Windows 8.1 Home factory install does have some extras, like Norton Internet Security, that can be uninstalled. However, I did my usual routine and backed up the system's factory installation and installed my own Windows 8.1 Professional installation. The 256 GB M.2 SSD drive is fast and Windows takes very little time to boot up to a working desktop. While the 2TB hdd is rated at 5400 RPM, I'm finding I don't notice as many slowdowns on drive access as I have on previously owned laptops.<br /><br />After Windows 10 was released I updated my laptop to Windows 10 Pro. The other laptop, my wife's, we left at Window 8.1 Pro as she's still getting used to the changes from her previous Window 7 Ultimate laptop.<br /><br />For the most part, build quality is excellent on this laptop - notable exception being the DVD R/W drive. The plastic rails on the drive feel fragile and I would suggest care when inserting and removing media. The keyboard from SteelSeries is very nice with decent travel on the keys and very quiet - no loud clicking when typing. The backlighting is great, and the keys are very readable with the backlight turned off. One nice addition is the button to turn on the exhaust fans at full speed. While somewhat noisy in a quiet space, it really helps to keep the system cooler.<br /><br />One thing we noticed is the built-in Dynaudio speakers are pretty quiet. Without the included Nahimic audio software, we struggled to hear much from the speakers. With the software enabled and configured, the sound volume is better, and the processing effects help enrich the quality as well. With headphones or decent speakers, the sound quality is pretty nice, especially with the Nahimic software set to one of its presets.<br /><br />Gaming performance so far has been pretty nice. Using the GeForce Experience software to set the Optimized Settings, I tried out a few demanding games to see how the system holds up. I'm using a copy of Fraps to determine the frames per second (fps).<br /><br />The Witcher 3 - 42-48 FPS - Excellent performance with the GeForce Experience optimized settings. Game feels fluid, looks great and controls well. Default resolution for the optimized settings was 1366x768 and bumping that up to 1920x1080 did result in a lower (25-29 FPS) framerate, but still playable.<br /><br />Minecraft - 60 FPS - Minecraft holds steady at 60 FPS with vsync on. With vsyn off, it hovers around 115 FPS. You do need to go into the nVidia Control Panel and force Java to use the nVidia GTX 960M in order to prevent video corruption. The onboard Intel HD 5600 doesn't play Minecraft that well.<br /><br />The Sims 3 - 115-130 FPS - This is on high settings across the board with all stuff packs, expansion packs and store content installed. However, the numbers don't take into account that while building, the game slows down tremendously; especially when using the recoloring tool. Live Mode is pretty steady, though get ready for more FPS drops while your Sims are running around the neighborhood. Medium settings do help somewhat, but the game obviously was not made with laptops in mind.<br /><br />The Sims 4 - 100-140 FPS - Ultra settings. Game runs fine with little to no stuttering. Less freamerate dips when travelling than with The Sims 3. Partly due to the game being better optimized for laptop players than The Sims 3.<br /><br />StarCraft II - 100-120 FPS - Smooth gameplay using GeForce Experience optimized settings.<br /><br />Overall, the gaming performance it quite nice and the added upgrades from CUK are well worth the money. If MSI could come up with a better sound solution and a sturdier rail system for the DVD R/W drive, it would be an easy 5/5 rating.<br /><br />Flynn","21"

"B0105JD1HE","Acer Aspire E5 17.3 Full HD Gaming Laptop","5","2015-08-16","Couldn't be happier","Purchased this laptop about a week ago. Came in before the estimated delivery date and have been more than happy with it thus far. For the price, this is a great deal. The only cons I have found in the time that I've had it is the touch pad and the speakers. The touch pad is junk and sometimes does not respond. This was only a problem until I purchased a mouse for it, which was the plan from the beginning. With the speakers being basically below the computer, it makes them muffled while using the laptop on your lap. Again, I usually use headphone so this was not that big of deal either. The windows 10 update went great with no problems. Much better than windows 8, just as good as windows 7 in my opinion. A lot of people are complaining about having to use two hands to open the screen which is true, but this doesn't bother me at all. Charges fairly fast while in use from my experience. Haven't done much gaming yet, but will be downloading some this week. These days, not having the dvd drive doesn't bother most people. This is the first computer I've got without the drive, and have not had a problem with it yet. Overall, very happy with this and would suggest it to anyone looking for a cheaper laptop without junk specs and hardware.","0"

"B0105JD1HE","Acer Aspire E5 17.3 Full HD Gaming Laptop","4","2015-08-20","Solid laptop - good buy for the money","*Update 11/1/15*<br /><br />After a few months of usage, the keyboard makes a weird rattling sound whenever you type.  Kind of annoying, going to ask amazon if there's a fix for it.<br /><br />** Original post **<br />The laptop itself is quite sleek, the performance side of things could definitely be much improved. I would't pay more than what I did ($570) for this though, honestly.<br /><br />Okay, here's the deal;<br /><br />The RAM speed is quite slow, single channel 8GB stick of DDr3L.  Speccy shows it at 792Mhz, double that (DDR) and get 1600Mhz.  It isn't too bad, but combine that with the slower mechanical portion of the HDD and you can sometimes be in for frustrating wait times.  I would suggest going for a SSD or at least a 7200RPM WD Black drive to replace it.<br /><br />The built in Atheros Wireless LAN/Bluetooth card seems to be lacking, I'm not sure why but some times my wireless speed is dreadfully slow.  I'm on the latest drivers running Windows 10 - but it was still moving slow with 8 too.  Hm.<br /><br />Boatware alert!  I would recommend doing a clean install before getting started with this laptop, if not, you will spend at least 2 hours uninstalling useless junk Acer puts on it for you.  I never understand why they (manufactures) do this...<br /><br />Battery life - 3-5 hours depending on what you're doing.  Not the best, but this thing is pretty slim for a 15.6&#34; laptop.<br /><br />Gaming performance - You get what you pay for, but I would strongly recommend this laptop for those who want to game on the go but not spend $900+ doing so.  This thing plays BF3 @ 60FPS on medium/high settings on a TDM server.  Sometimes it dips, but come on - a dual core i5 with such a low clock speed and a GT 940m? Yeah, that's pretty good.  AOE 3 plays smoothly on high, C&C Generals is also smooth - BeamNG.Drive runs smooth @ medium.<br /><br />This model does NOT come with a DVD/CD RW drive - but there is an empty slot (covered ofcourse) so you can add one later.  I just got a dinky little $15 external one from amazon and called it good.<br /><br />The keyboard is very nice to type on, nice and solid.  Not back lit though, unfortunately.<br /><br />Final verdict:  4/5 stars<br /><br />This is a great laptop for students who don't want to spend a fortune on a gaming laptop, but want the functionality of a normal laptop as well.  This will certainly get the job done!  Though the SSHD portion makes up for some of the speed lost on a 5400RPM HDD, it's definitely capable of much more.  I suggest this with a couple sticks of 1600Mhz 8GB DDr3L gaming series RAM and slap either a nice size SSD or 7200RPM HDD and call it good.<br /><br />Good job, Acer!  This is one solid PC!","1"

"B00REWLE98","Lenovo Y50 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (59441402) Black","1","2015-08-29","Recommend avoiding Lenovo Y50s.","Ordered 3 Lenovo laptops as gifts. All developed video problems, with horizontal lines flickering across the screen and the display going black when the screen was repositioned..  Two were returned to Lenovo for repair, all costs paid for by Lenovo. The screen and video cable to the display were replaced. One took a little over two weeks to get back, the other was back in one week.  Third one Lenovo said they were out of repair parts and to return to seller.  Unless we had a horrible string of bad luck, these laptops have an endemic problem with the display. We're hoping the repaired ones will be good to go, but if they just replaced them with the same screen/cable, then the problem seems likely to recur.  Buy the Y50 with caution. I'm giving it 3-stars dependent on how well the repairs hold up, as otherwise the performance of the laptop is very good for the price.  EDIT:  Reduced to 1-star.  Had to return one of the computers to the Lenovo Repair Depot for the 2nd time, same issue with the screen.  We've had the computers for 6 months, and that's three repairs so far.  It's obvious that it is a design or quality control issue with the part that keeps failing.  On the current repair, the Lenovo Repair Depot has run out of spare parts (apparently ours hasn't been the only computers with this problem) and estimated 2 months before spare parts would be available.  The computer is our son's college computer, and we can't afford to have it out of service for two months.  We asked Lenovo to return it to us, which they did promptly, but they reimaged the hard drive before returning the computer, so all files on it were erased.","2"

In fact I ordered it the day it was available. And I must say after receiving it, this computer has amazing specs. I hear people complaining about the textured track pad being 'annoying' but frankly if you're into gaming (I.E. THE ONLY REASON YOU'D BE PURCHASING A GAMING LAPTOP) you will love it. The textured track pad makes any kind of mouse movement feel much more responsive than on any other device I've EVER used. When it comes to gaming, for a laptop, it's hard to get much better for this price. I'm tired of people comparing gaming laptops to 2 year old custom PCs... They are completely different beasts. So be realistic and stop comparing apples to oranges. I've been able to play every game I have on ultra settings and still get over 60 fps which let's face it, is not really noticeable above that. Battery power is not an issue if you use common sense and switch performance modes away from sport to comfort or even green when you're unplugged from the wall. The included software is incredibly impressive. I mean who doesn't want to give certain apps more of a claim to bandwidth than others? In my opinion, this is an amazing rig for the money and MSI has a guaranteed repeat customer with me.","109"

My recommendation is to use a dedicated USB 3.0 hub.  I use the &#34;Pluggable 7-Port USB 3.0 Superspeed Charging Hub&#34; (USB3-HUB7BC) - also a very good product.<br /><br />The cable management hooks on the SF-19 are also useful.","3"

The solid state hard drive boots up in about 5 seconds flat saving tons of boot-up and shut-down time in the long run. The display is well fixed to the main body of the laptop so that on trains and planes it doesn't wobble around. I find that the keys sometimes don't register when I type. It will just be a letter here and there, but it happens regularly (just happened while I was typing this, in fact). My battery life seems to be a bit low even though I've had it for a little over half a year. All things considered though, this is a powerful laptop that makes me very satisfied and my tech-savvy girlfriend super jealous!","0"

Overall I'm reasonably satisfied with the laptop, however there are a few key factors which concern me a little.<br />1) The screen seems pretty flimsy and week - I don't have much confidence in it's longevity.<br />2) While it has a nice graphics card, and should be capable of putting out a nice HD display, the LCD itself is very low quality, making the graphics card somewhat pointless. I may replace it's LCD with the LCD of the laptop this is replacing, but I can't imagine that being a practical solution for many buyers.<br />3) You might expect, as it's designed as a gaming laptop, that the trackpad isn't very good because everyone would be expecting to use a mouse. You'd be correct, the trackpad is pathetic.<br />4) As is always the case with MSI, there's lots of proprietary software or &#34;bloatware.&#34; With a new computer, I usually spend a fair amount of time downloading and installing new things - it's never fun when I also have to uninstall and get rid of a bunch of useless things as well.<br />5) Peripherals: I've yet to test out the microphone, the speakers seem fairly good quality, but the camera's quality i horrible.<br /><br />Other than the flimsy screen, the build quality is pretty nice and the general specifications are good. With a better LCD, I'd say this is a great mid-price-range gaming laptop.","8"

The SSD, GPU, everything works as it should. By all means, this is the very best laptop I have ever used and it performs very well in all my benchmark tests and in actual gameplay, and is great at multitasking video editing software and lots of other things.<br /><br />However, I am knocking a star off for the refurbished models. If you are wanting to save a few hundred dollars to get a refurbished model... don't. My computer works and there is nothing wrong from a hardware perspective, but I have literally wasted my entire saturday (it arrived early in the morning) getting the computer into working order. For starters, they install the operating system on the wrong hard drive. Sine install drives don't come with and there is no optical drive, it's hard to simply re-install the OS on the other drive. It CAN be done via drive cloning, but this is in precise and for me, required messing with the BIOS and even the registry to get it to actually boot from the SSD.<br /><br />The computer also came without any of hte drivers. It's literally a clean install of windows 8.1. That means you want that alienware command center? Better go find it on dell's website. But that's not hte worst of it - because it lacks drivers, things like the 970m are not even recognized. You won't notice until you actually do something with the GPU, and this is pretty annoying. The wrong drivers are installed for everything, so you basically have to do everything yourself. Plug and play? Not so for the refurbished models. The ones from dell's outlet store I hear have the same issues.<br /><br />Basically, the computer has a piece of hardware is fantastic, but they do the bare minimum for everything else on refurbished models. You need to be fairly tech savvy to be able to deal with it.<br /><br />I will put up a full review of the system later once I get the 970m to start working, and I have time to fully test out the full capabilities of the system. I just wanted to get a warning out there for anyone who gets the refurbished model - you're in for a lot of work.","7"

Not the best, but I use and external mouse mostly.<br /><br />It's been pretty quiet for me so far, though it does get a bit hot.<br /><br />One thing I'm a little bit concerned about is the power adapter's buzzing sound. I don't know if it's a bad sign, but it doesn't seem normal.<br /><br />Overall, for the price it's a good deal. It works for me as I'm using it mostly for on-the-go music production, so the screen issue doesn't bother me much -- it works for me.<br /><br />I just need to find out if the buzzing noise is something to worry about.","0"

I have to say this thing is a beast. I run Skyrim at max graphics with an ENB and it runs flawlessly, and it can run GTA5 online without so much as a hiccup. The only thing I want to change about this laptop is the matte black metal finish. It looks nice, but it catches oil and smudges like crazy.

I had this laptop for about 6 weeks and was pleased until it completely crashed and is stuck in the BIOS.<br /><br />Pros: Affordability, IPS screen is good, runs cool, SSD is good option, 960m handles anything including video editing well.<br />Cons: Reliability, every finger print (every single one) shows on laptop.<br /><br />More about the reliability issue and what prompted me to write a review. Laptop was running fine until it just crashed and got stuck in the BIOS. I tried looking online and found multiple people reporting issues like this with Asus laptops with this BIOS. It's to the point that I have just had to return it to Asus (after 3 tech support calls) and will await an outcome.<br /><br />I understand anything can have a problem but it seems a little too common based on my research. I wish I had learned this prior to purchasing. Also, the BIOS on this laptop was very limited in comparison to the one on my ASUS motherboard which is 3 years old. Even worse, the phone tech was thinking that this machine was shipped without the windows recovery partition included, making recovery impossible without sending back to Asus.<br /><br />Hopefully there is a good resolution, but it is too little too late. I cannot recommend a product that seems to have reliability concerns and a lack of recovery options.","2"

This rig runs like a mid-high end desktop for only 1.2k which is a well worth it investment. For reference, I purchased the 16GB Ram + 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD version. To clear up the uncertainties that i had while buying is that some of the pictures do not preview the specific model that this laptop is. You can tell because this laptop has dual fans with exhaust out the back. The base model from MSi is the GE62 Apache Pro 2QD. The computer comes with everything stated in the description. I could only assume that windows was installed on the extra SSD, not the HDD because windows on the SSD would be very fast. This is not stated however in the description. I can confirm atleast for my specific, configuration, that windows IS installed on the SSD. I must also say that the trackpad is annoying due to the directional grain and the key backlights hit your eyes if you lean away from your computer but both of those are not very major issues due to mouse substitution and the Steel Series lighting manager. The box is in the same condition that CUK would have recieved it in. CUK also gives you a great warranty that will surely provide protection for a decent amount of time. Overall a great laptop and would recommend it to others. CUK did a fantastic job with this laptop and it will be put to use. Last mention; ive read that CUK is also very good with customer service so if you have any more wuestions, im sure they'll be helpful","20"

"B00RVUMRKS","MSI GE62 APACHE-002 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop","5","2015-07-04","Perfect for someone that games on the go, or for someone that needs a good combination of power and portability.","There aren't many reviews for this particular laptop so I decided to write one myself, while I have owned laptops in the past I have never owned a gaming laptop.  This review will be in three separate parts first will be ease of upgrade, second will be build quality and last will be performance.<br /><br />Ease of Upgrade<br />The first thing I did when I received the laptop was to turn it on to make sure it wasn't DOA, after that I immediately opened it up and installed a m.2 ssd and some extra ram in it.  Opening the device was for the most part simple, unfortunately removing the bottom requires you to tamper with a &#34;warranty void if tampered&#34; sticker which is a shame.  There is two RAM slots max 8GB each for a total of 16GB (make shure you get DDR3L SODIMM RAM sticks), three m.2 ssd slots also exist, the center can use ether PCIE or a SATA ssd while the two on the sides can only support SATA ssds there is also a 2.5 drive spot as well, you can also swap out the optical drive for a blu-ray drive or even a 2.5 hard drive adapter.  It is also worth noting that the battery looks like it can be easily replaced.  After reinstalling the OS the device boots at around 3 to 5 seconds and is generally very responsive.<br /><br />Build Quality<br />The laptops outer shell (with the exception of the bottom) is built entirely out of metal, this makes the device (particularly the screen) pretty sturdy while still being pretty thin compared to laptops made entirely of plastic, it however, shows fingerprints very well.  The screen technology is i believe a very high quality tn panel.  However, the viewing angle is still pretty good, the screen is a 1080p matte display, the matte finish makes this laptop easier to use outdoors then a glossy display.  The rgb keyboard and touch pad work pretty well, not great but what I expected, the rgb part gives some extra customization and some neat effects however.<br /><br />Performance<br />I don't usually do benchmarks and this is no exception.  I, however do a decent amount of gaming in my free time and this laptop (as long as it is plugged in) does very well.  In 1080p I get usually around or over 60 fps in high to ultra settings in most games, however when unplugged the laptop insists on using the cpu's integrated graphics to save power, causing not only decreased performance but also in many cases buggy gameplay and even crashing some games. This is not a problem if the laptop is plugged in and thus using the nvidia gpu, you can force the laptop to use the nvidia gpu when not plugged in, but your battery life will tank to around 30 minutes to 1 hour.  With the nvidia gpu disabled and if you aren't doing anything demanding you will get around 2 to 4 hours from my experience.  It is also worth noting that the fans only get loud when the cpu is under load, not the gpu, and even then it is not obnoxiously loud nor does the laptop get terribly hot, It will get warm though.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />For the price, (its not cheap but for what you get its a pretty good deal) all of my complaints aren't severe enough to take away a star, I would recommend this over offerings from similarly priced laptops.f gaming in my free time and this laptop (as long as it is plugged in) does very well.

Un-boxing was easy, I didn't realize this laptop came with a Asus ROG gaming mouse but I ordered a Corsair M65 anyway.  The mouse provided by Asus is nice, nothing to knock it but I prefer the Corsair.<br /><br />First impressions upon boot up were all positive, laptop came preloaded with windows 8.1 on the SSD which made first time bootup quick and painless.  Once start up was done I shut it down then booted back up because I was curious to see how fast it would boot from the SSD and it is blazing fast, seconds from full shutdown to desktop loaded.<br /><br />I loaded up a few games right out of the gate and started running some benchmark FPS averages.  With Arma 3 running on all ultra settings I was averaging 39-50 FPS.  Running Arma 2 on the highest settings was getting me 60+ FPS and the same goes for Counter Strike: Source.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the smudges and fingerprints that are easily left behind when using this laptop. I would agree with them  fingerprints are pretty visible and do linger but a damp paper towel wipes them all away and you get a good as new look.  I did not lower the stars for this because this is a very sharp looking laptop, the red back lit keyboard is nice in darker environments and can be shut off if you do not want it on.<br /><br />Sound quality from the speakers I would put with on par with the rest of the competition, not the best, far from the worst.  While playing the games I mentioned before I was using the on board speakers and I didn't feel like game play was lost in any way due using the on board speakers.<br /><br />One item this laptop and I would say most gaming laptops do need is a cooling pad, I ordered a Havit cooling fan for it while gaming.  While gaming the exhaust does heat up and the cooling pad does do a good job at keeping temps low.  I definitely wouldn't be gaming with this laptop onmy lap but basic use, surfing the web and that kind of stuff, keeps the laptop pretty cool and having it on my lap for a couple hours while surfing the web was no issue at all.<br /><br />Overall I gave this laptop 5 stars because it has done everything I expected and more.  Gaming is amazing on this laptop, price point is great compared to the rest of the competition for what you get, and you can't go wrong with Asus 1 year no questions asked warranty.  I was pleasantly surprised that I have 1 year of full coverage on any issues, spills, drops, breaks, anything.","0"

I pit out the extra cash for the IPS display and integrated SSD memory. If this is going to be your main computer, I strongly suggest buying it with these upgrades. The monitor is stunning, and the computer boots up in 4 seconds flat (I'm not exaggerating.) I'm a graphic designer/gamer, and this computer meets all of my needs. A word to the wise: this is a relatively small laptop that has a LOT of hardware stuffed into it. Its going to get warm when its in standby, and hot while you're gaming. You absolutely NEED a laptop cooler if you plan to put this machine through its paces. I once ruined a RoG laptop by making this mistake. I suggest a fan with an aluminum surface for the PC to sit on. I use the NotePal XSlim as I found it to be enough to keep this laptop cool during the most intense gaming sessions without generating any noticeable sound, but there are plenty of options out there to choose from.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the specs, so I will try to focus more on the machine itself and how it fits into my life.<br /><br />Graphics: So far I have played Borderlands 1 & 2 and Skyrim (with texture mods!) on this computer. I run both at max graphics without so much as a hiccup. I have run Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC simultaneously and I could not even MAKE this computer lag. Plenty of RAM here.<br /><br />External: Lots of USB ports, a couple of them 3.0 slots. This thing has every hole you could possibly want on a 2015 computer. HDMI, mini HDMI, SSD...and a DVD player. The player is somewhat of a letdown, as I would think that Asus could cough up an integrated Blu Ray player on their laptops these days. It would have been nice to copy some of my favorite Blu Rays on my laptop &#34;to go,&#34; but alas, you will be restricted to DVDs only here. (NOTE TO ASUS: DVD players haven't been practical for the last 6 years. It's time for an upgrade.)<br /><br />The keyboard gorgeously lights up and can be dimmed or turned off completely. I'm used to 15.6&#34; laptops + I have small hands, so the key placement did not bother me. Some may find it cramped.<br /><br /> The mouse pad feels a bit awkward, as the mouse &#34;buttons&#34; are actually just pressable points on the mouse pad, and I find myself accidentally moving the cursor or clicking the wrong button. Luckily, Asus included a nifty gaming mouse so you won't have to deal with their weird design.<br /><br />The speakers are nothing to write home about. I have certainly heard better, but they're not awful. Good enough for casual gaming and jamming sessions, but anything more and you will want a good set of headphones.<br /><br />All in all, a great gaming laptop. If you're on a budget, this is the best thing out there for the price.","0"

Played GTA V at Normal at 50 FPS just fine and looked beautiful, although it doesn't have enough VRAM to handle going up to High. Able to play Metro: Last Light on High with a large amount of the settings turned up to full blast and still run smoothly. Lighter games graphically stand no chance and makes this laptop shrug them off as if they were merely in the way. About 900 MB to play with when you get it and the screen looks good. Only downsides are the speakers aren't that great (I'd suggest using an external one or headphones) and, as one customer pointed out amusingly, the finish on the laptops cover is a serious pain to clean off fingerprints. Not sure why. Best way I've found is to using my breadth and a cloth but it takes a bit to clean each fingerprint. There may be a better way but I can't figure it out.<br /><br />Still a great laptop for midrange gaming if you were looking for an upgrade like I was.","0"

I did plentiful research, and came to the conclusion of finally purchasing the product. Even when asked if it were a scam on a forum, an employee of the company (presumably) had discussed how they are more concerned of customer support rather than a flashy site. I clicked on the users name and he was a confirmed employee. The brand eluktronics does impress when it comes down to how much they care. Unlike big boy companies like ibuypower, and cyberpower, eluktronics guarantees that you get your moneys worth.<br /><br />The good:<br />Laptop is sturdy, so far, no bends/breaks scratches etc.<br />VERY powerful for a laptop. IT could run Dragon age inquisition at 40-50 fps maxed/ultra settings.<br />White led lights, adjustable brightness so you don't strain your eyes.<br />The keyboard is heavenly to type on.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The left side of the speakers are hammered in, however the right side seems like it was glued on? and the glue has aged.<br />The very bottom half of the space key suffers from working all the time, however all of the space key works fine.<br />The gtx 970m is supposed to score 7200ish on 3dmark, however I scored 6600. (I'm not sure why, it may be the dust)<br /><br />The you variable:<br />Internet does not connect all the time. Which makes it a chore to constantly restart. It's been a consistent pattern, which I intend to speak to my internet provider about.<br /><br />Eluktronics as a company:<br />Reliable. Trustworthy. Seriously, don't mess around, you see a laptop you really want? Go to eluktronics, it's probably cheaper, and their customer service are real people. Not robots who are indoctrinated by corporate to sing their tunes.<br /><br />Laptop:8.7/10<br />Eluktronics: 9.2/10<br /><br />The flaws are minor. The score on 3DMARK does concern me, however I did practice the demo version. (It was firestrike). If I do clean it out, and no changes are seen to the score, I will contact eluktronics. But I am impressed with eluktronics. as a company. I have little to no criticism.I will update after I clean it out for sure.","3"

The laptop is a finger print magnet but it's easy to clean off. Just get some water and damp a cloth and wipe away. The buttons are plastic but are really nice and have a nice tactile feel.

The first time around, the touchpad decided to freeze entirely on me.  Toggling with Fn+F7 didn't help, nor did rebooting or reinstalling the drivers.  Acer instructed me to perform a factory reset on the computer which restored partial functionality to the touchpad, but it still struggled to register right-clicks consistently.  I finally decided that it wasn't worth fighting with my computer over something so simple—especially after paying $1,000— so I returned the laptop.  It's a shame, because everything else about the Acer V17 is great: the screen is crisp and bright; the keyboard is comfortable and responsive; the sound is leagues above my old laptop; the whole thing is absolutely beautiful to look at with its clean lines and backlit keyboard.

"B00YR6BI04","ASUS G751JY 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","5","2015-07-22","Simply the best gaming laptop out there","There were several versions of the Asus G751JY, but I decided since I was going to spend a good chunk of change, I might as well purchase the one with the highest specs out there. There are several competitors out there including Alienware, MSI, Origin, Lenovo, Toshiba, etc, but I have good reasons to stick with the pros at Asus. The most important thing in a gaming laptop or any high spec laptop would be the cooling. Without proper cooling, you end up with a loud and unreliable machine. Investing thousands in a laptop means I expected the best cooling system in the world. Asus included dual copper heat sinks with dual fans that sucks in air from the sides through the ports and pushes that air through the rear vents. The machine stays very quiet and cool, even under intense loads.  Another appealing aspect of this laptop is the simple, yet unique design that blends beauty and attitude all in one package. It looks serious due to the black matte surfaces, but it shows its beautiful seamless design in the metallic red painted rear vents, red lighted Republic of Gamers logo on the cover and the user adjustable red glowing keyboard. The materials used are high quality, starting with the metal trim on the cover that sweeps to the bottom of the laptop and ending with the matte plastic throughout the laptop. The metal trim, matte plastic and hard plastic are all very well constructed together. In my opinion, this laptop is far more beautiful than any overrated, overpriced Apple MACs.  The specs are overkill, but that's a good thing because it means it will stay relevant 3 years down the road. The parts inside are also of high quality, made by companies known for longevity and high specs. Being an IT Professional, the first thing I did was research the manufacturers of each component by using software and by opening the user serviceable panel on the bottom of the laptop. The CPU of course is made by Intel. The GPU is the famous Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M, which is the first mobile chip to rival desktop chips. The motherboard is made by Asus, which is a good thing because they are known as the world leader in motherboards. The 512GB SSDs (2x256GB) are made by Samsung, which is another win for consumers, because Samsung makes the world's fastest and most reliable SSDs. The RAM is made by Samsung as well, which is not world leading class, but quite decent. I decided to upgrade the laptop without voiding the warranty, so I removed 2 Samsung RAM sticks and put in 2 G.Skill gaming grade RAM sticks. I also took out the 1TD HDD and replaced it with a Samsung 2TB EVO 850 SSD for extra storage. Expensive, yes, but now I have a laptop that is awesome sick.  With the world's best cooling system, monster specs, Asus reliability and beautiful design, this laptop will surpass demanding expectations. It is built to last, comfortable to use and attractive to look at. The only negative aspect of this laptop lies on its non-removable battery. Batteries tend to lose its capacity after 3 years of use so this means you will have to send it in for service instead of just popping in another battery. Other than this small annoyance, this laptop is perfect and ready to dominate the world. Seriously, no other gaming laptop even comes close to the quality and thoughtfulness Asus has put into making this product.","41"

I only play WoW and previously owned Alienware m15x, and every generation of MacBook Pro. I love Alienware but time is changing. Until they make serious design changes I just can't see myself lug it around anymore. Everyone is making sleek laptops and get with the program. I am a frequent traveler and do a lot of gaming in hotel rooms and Starbucks. Still love the MacBook Pro and will keep it. But it's sad a $2500 laptop cannot play WoW at high resolution? When Omen first came out, I was drawn to the design, but discouraged by the lukewarm reviews. I saw this UPDATED VERSION at Best Buy and fell in love. Of course they don't have it in stock. They promised to order it for me as a favor. Amazon dropped it off at my door next day 😜.<br /><br />Display 9/10<br />Processor 9/10<br />Graphic Card 8/10<br />Design 10/10<br />Weight 8/10<br /><br />So let's say I can play u WoW on ultra at 50-90 FPS. So I suspect this will keep up for 3 years. The screen is a beautiful piece of black glass, perfect in every way except not as bright as Mac but better than Alienware, thus not a 10 in my book. 1080p is the sweet spot because anything higher means you have to lower the graphic setting on games, so what's the point if it's a gaming laptop? I compared processors with similar priced laptop on Amamzon, this is better than MSI G60 Ghost pro and Asus Nitro. So that is pretty much the tie breaker for me. The card, GTX 960M. I was a little worried because it's &#34;mid range&#34; gaming card. So far it serves my purpose but it may be problem if you plan to keep this computer for more than 3 years. They keyboard feels OK. I don't plan to type on it much so I can't tell you. The lighting on keys and computer itself is ho hum if you are used to Mac and Alienware. It's neither bright nor vibrant. And come on HP no lit logo on the lid for gaming laptop!!!???? Put your Omen logo and light it up with pride!<br /><br />Well overall this makes me very happy! I remember getting my $1500 Alienware and realize it could not play WoW on Ultra and I almost died. And next version of MacBook Pro has some bargain basement graphic card. So I can say I can play WoW on ultra even during raids without any frame rate stutter.tting my $1500 Alienware and realize it could not play WoW on Ultra and I almost died.

As others have noted, the disc drive button activates far too easily and often, and the speakers scratch a little at certain frequencies (something I'm sure any audiophile could fix but I cannot). Complaints about flimsy construction couldn't be more inaccurate; its sturdy despite it's ridiculous weight. The fingerprints do stick on the matte plastic, but unless you are extremely obsessed with cleanliness they aren't very bothersome. The keyboard feels nice, good click and actuation force. The trackpad at first seemed annoyingly not slick, but after about five minutes of wear it works beautifully; shortcuts and all. It has two mechanical buttons as well, a godsend in these days of trackpad-integrated buttons (eugh). The display is absolutely GORGEOUS, wide viewing angles is very accurate, both horizontally and vertically. The brightness is astounding (not sure, but I believe I was told 300 nits); I went out at full brightness and angled the glare directly at the sun and it was still visible (with only a slight squint necessary, which I can thank the matte display for). As for games; Skyrim Legendary Edition with the High Res textures ran beautifully at 49FPS in windowed mode (have yet to test full screen, but I imagine there would be a difference). The laptop ran cool with everything I threw at it except (oddly enough) minecraft, which heated it up dramatically but not to the point of discomfort. no issues with the USB's as others have suggested. Charging brick is a brick, but it's an effective brick, so it's fine (though it weighs about the same as the darn laptop). Will update if anything changes, but so far no issues at all, VERY happy with my purchase ^-^","0"

This laptop boots in 15 seconds and on the 16th you can already be looking at your favorite webpage or  whatever you want to do with it. I'd give it 5 stars if it had Windows 7, but sadly it comes with Microsoft's latest (should be abortion). First thing i did was installing a Windows 7 shell. It's a top notch laptop, which runs games my desktop rig runs. Picture is crystal clear, keyboard stays cool even when CPU and GPU heat up over 85 C. While i was writing this review and was watching a HD movie on the 2nd monitor, the CPU temperature was between 40 and 45 C.<br /><br />I plugged in a portable regular USB 3.0 HDD and Diablo 3 installed on it starts in about 15 seconds The fact the laptop only has an internal 256 GB SSD is not a hindrance at all. With all the streaming services, for most people 256 GB will be well enough and like I said at the begining, it makes all the difference in the world. I don't understand why producers of high end laptop  insist on installing old spinning HDD's because they are by far the slowest part of the system. At the very least they should install Hybrid drives and better yet a SSD + HDD combo.<br /><br />16 GB of RAM means that the 2nd thing i did was disabling the swap file.","2"

Will probably update the review and add more in the next days but saw there are no other reviews and wanted to fix that. Everything came in perfect condition via Amazon Prime. The screen was perfect, no dead pixels.    Initial reactions are that at first I thought that perhaps there was no BD-rom because the tray said DVD multi but not to worry I soon discovered it was indeed a bd drive. I was able to play one Blu-ray in Cyberlink's PowerDVD program which was included but another one would not play. Once I installed my anyDVD HD, every Blu-ray played fine using VLC. I didn't use the CyberLink anymore after that so I don't know if it would have been compatible with anyDVD but to use the Cyberlink and get it all to work I think I might have needed to upgrade to a paid version of PowerDVD which I did not want to do right now.    There was really no bloatware to speak of. I ran my malware programs and found some small stuff and removed it. Nothing major. McAfee was installed but I just replaced that with another program I prefer.    The laptop is physically really nice. The body and skin are amazing. The top area all around the keyboard keys feels like silicone a bit, very smooth. The keys are comfortably placed. Wish I could set a different back lighting color than red but that's ok. The overall look is really nice anyway. I am not a gamer but an artist who needs a high performance machine. I DO play games on steam so will write more about that experience later as I update this review.    The laptop was comfortable to use and everything seems well-placed for me.  On another review of an Asus rog, someone complained about the place where the Ethernet cable goes being in the way on the right side where one might be using a mouse. I can see that if one is physically connected to Ethernet but since I am using it wirelessly and since I don't use the mouse on the right side of the computer but more in front of it, even though I am righthanded, I don't have any issue there. I did plug in the HDMI cable to a second monitor and that cable is close to the middle as well and I'm not bothered by it there. The second monitor connected effortlessly. The computer has a nice form factor over all. It is lightning fast, but with 32 GB of memory, of course. Boots quickly. The display is excellent, no issues from any angle.    ### Updates ###    Used it on my lap today. While it's slightly heavier than other less high-powered laptops, it was comfortable. It's a solid machine, nothing flimsy about. I had worried about the size and weight but it's a non-issue. A gamer or art person that would use this would definitely want the larger display.","34"

I'm very glad I did. I'm not a huge gamer but I do have several PC games and a couple that my cheap desktop pc can't handle well and this laptop is like Hercules in terms of power - no problems at all playing anything I throw at it. It's also not that heavy, if you ask me. I read reviews that it's quite a bit to lug around but to me it's really not very heavy at all. But then, my last Dell laptop years ago was also 17 inches and big so maybe I'm just used to it. It's definitely not a Mac Airbook but it's not like carrying a sack of bricks, either. One feature I love is that there are air vents around the back side and not just on the bottom so it doesn't overheat like my last laptop did, although I still use a cooling pad underneath.<br /><br />I bought a refurbished one and the one thing I wish they would have left alone was Windows 7. It was refurbished to Windows 8.1, which I don't think is as terrible as reviews have made it seem but it takes getting used to. I find it kind of strange that the desktop is an &#34;app&#34; instead of just the default screen when you power on and you have to hit the windows logo + X to see options that normally pop up when you press the start button or the logo in the bottom left corner of other Windows systems. But this is a minor issue. I prefer Windows 7 but with a little patience and enough time to explore, Windows 8 is easy enough to learn and get used to.<br /><br />Overall, it's worth the purchase. I can finally play games that lagged on my desktop and I can play them on something portable so I'm not confined to one room. It feels sturdy and well-built and it looks beautiful as well.","2"

Cons:  This is thing is Massive. 2 out of the 4 USB ports does not work well as the others. The back two USB ports do not recognize or disconnect my wireless Dongle. It will do this repeatedly or randomly. Also does the same when I have my iPhone connected. The Fan makes a loud pulsating vibration/Hum during medium to High speeds. The grill also annoyingly Vibrates excessively during Medium to High speeds.    Overall verdict: I would recommend looking for something else.    Update: 10 FEB 2015    I returend the CM SF-19 Unit back to AMAZON and gave CM a second chance. This time I purchased the CM SF-15.  Compared to the CM SF-19, this one is quiet.  There are some draw backs though and the same USB problems as the first Unit with the rear 2 USB's dropping connection, but this one is all of the USB ports. The fan has only 1 Speed ( between Low and medium, compared to the CM SF-19 ) still decent and quiet, LED has one color Red and this unit does not come with a power adapter. I would recommend not wasting your time with CM and look into something that just does cooling, instead of extra USB ports.    BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT BUY Cooler Master. Both Units are Defective.","1"

I was planning on using this laptop as a workstation but the screen quality has made me decide to return it. Even if you're not an artist you'll probably notice that the colors are washed out and images are slightly blurry. No matter how I adjusted the display it was worse at displaying colors (particularly hot pink, grays, and greens?) than other, cheaper laptops in the house that also had TN displays. I'm going to go over some things I've learned about this computer's display:<br /><br />- This laptop has the same display as the lenovo Y50: the AUO36ED. Reviews of that laptop I've seen do mention that the screen quality is poor. Even using an ICC profile will only marginally improve the performance of the screen.<br /><br />- Disabling 'Vivid' on ASUS Splended also slightly helps.<br /><br />- Don't be fooled: This laptop has a very close cousin that has an IPS display you may have seen in reviews. The only difference is that model does not have an L in the name. As of writing this, that model is not available for purchase in the US as far as I've seen.<br /><br />- Lastly: Blurry Text is surprisingly NOT caused by the quality of the screen. That's an issue with 8.1's scaling. If you do end up getting this laptop and want to fix that all you have to do is right click the program with blurry text, go to properties, click the compatibility tab and uncheck 'Disable Display Scaling On High DPI Settings'","11"

I was skeptical at first because everyone tends to pay more attention to the bad and mediocre reviews than they do the good ones when making purchasing decisions.  My fears were completely unfounded.<br /><br />The Screen:  I'll admit, I don't know the difference between IPS or anything but the screen is fine.  Yes, some words may appear a little blurry but, from what I've seen, that's likely due to the resolution of the document you're looking at.  I have no problems with viewing angles or anything else and just about everything shows up sharp and clear.<br /><br />The Chasis:  It is a fingerprint magnet and they really don't come off, but unless you're going to be using this with multiple pairs of latex gloves on you'll get used to it.  I don't look at my laptop to see pretty dark smoothness, I mainly look at the screen `\o.O/`<br /><br />The Guts (lol):  this SSD has me completely sold on SSD's &#62; HDD's.  I will never buy another HDD again.  When I build my next desktop it will have a SSD for the main drive.  Even after removing the little bloatware the system comes with and then fixing the partition issue (the SSD comes pre-partitioned and it really doesn't leave much room for programs on the operating side of the wall, but Windows 8.1 has a partitioning program native to it just google search it) and then loading all of the software that I use on a daily and not-so daily basis this beast still runs lightning fast.  From boot to being usable:  about 6 seconds.  Seriously and I have a bunch of programs on it.  I used to be able to go to the bathroom, grab a beer from downstairs and still be waiting for my laptop to completely boot up, but not this one.<br /><br />My previous laptop was another Asus RoG G53JW and this one is head and shoulders above it.  I always had an issue with the way the power pin connected to the laptop from the PSU.  It would break off inside of the PSU connection point.While the laptop was still under warranty this was fairly annoying as I'd have to contact ASUS customer support and then deal with mailing it in for repairs.  After warranty, I tried to have a mom&pop place fix it but they must have used the wrong power pin because after a month it burnt my mother board to a crisp.  This laptop has the connection in an &#34;L&#34; shape and the connection isn't such a heavy weight on the laptop so I don't think I'll have problems with it.<br /><br />The Video Card:  I was wary about only having a GTX860 (I looked at relative comparisons on many review sites) but again, my fears were unfounded.  This laptop can handle all of the games that I play at Ultra settings with everything turned on and still have an HDMI plugged in and watch downloaded movies in 1080p on my TV with no stutter or lag or tearing on either the movie or my game.<br /><br />The CPU & RAM:  It's an i7 with 16gb of ram.  What more needs to be said?<br /><br />Overall I wish it had one more USB port as I have to keep one occupied because of my cooling pad.  I highly suggest getting a cooling pad because this laptop does get fairly hot and you will want to cool as well as you can to prolong the life of the parts and your purchase.  Your best bet is to get a pad that has an extra USB port on it or uses a flow-thru USB connection.

Another one that drives me kinda bonkers is the keyboard. It works great when it is actually working.  I find myself having to restart the computer 2 or 3 times before the keyboard turns on again occasionally though. Not sure if it's just mine or a common problem with all touchscreens.  But hey, if you don't care for keyboards anyway, kudos to you. It is worth the money!  Very good for gaming too. I love playing Sims on it. Screen is super nice.","5"

You will need to set the nvidia as the default graphics in the nvidia control panel.<br /><br />Also if you run games on this laptop on high power mode and unplugged the games will be locked at 30fps. If you want to have the full gaming experience you will need to play with the laptop plugged in ( this will allow for games to run at 60fps).<br /><br />Another thing is if you try to play games with an external hard drive plugged in the computer will crash with a power state error. This is fixed if you play games with the laptop charger connected. this computer needs the extra power of being plugged in to run properly.<br /><br />the computer is a smudge magnet so I would suggest buying some micro fiber clothes to clean it.<br /><br />Overall I really like the computer. I am able to play most games on high settings. The 16 gig of ram means you really don't need an upgrade. The processor is great since it turbos to around 3.3-3.5 ghz. The nvidia geforce gtx 860 is able to run most of the modern games out there.<br /><br />I do reccomened this computer to anyone who is looking for a good gaming laptop. Asus makes really good computers and I only buy Asus for my computers.","3"

First of all, this machine has really good specs. Don't let the processor fool you, it played any game I threw at it (including Far Cry 4, and Crysis 3, even if I had to put it to the lowest of settings to make it run) without much of a hiccup. I was looking for a laptop that I would use mostly for work, but could game when I needed to blast some baddies.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Processor is good enough to handle today's games, even if the GPU isn't.<br />Geforce 840M does a decent job and will play most of today's games<br />Wifi card is among the better that I've had<br /><br />Cons:<br />No backlight. I know this may seem minor, but at this price point I kind of expect one<br />No num/scroll/caps lock indicators<br />Acer has a long history of QC issues. More information below<br />Touchpad is bad. Not terrible, not okay, but somewhere in between.<br />Keyboard is also bad. Again, not terrible, not okay, but somewhere in between.<br /><br />So a few words of warning. This laptop is natively at 1366x768. It does this so it can play some of the heavier titles. For the screen size, you don't notice it in terms of pixellation, but be prepared for a smaller &#34;work space&#34; despite the screen size. Like I mentioned before, it plays even today's games just fine, but you have to play at low to medium. Dropping the resolution is not really an option as you are already pushing the resolution at this screen size. On a plus side, the wifi card seems pretty good (or maybe it's the antenna setup?). I get full signal almost everywhere I go inside my apartment where my other devices start dropping 1-2 bars.<br /><br />Now, onto the troubles I had:<br />First off, right out of the box my speakers were making a very annoying and loud buzzing/rattling sound. Noticeable at Window's volume setting of about 20% or more. I had to RMA this (pay for return shipping out of my own pocket) and the seller (not Amazon) is charging me for a restocking fee... which just adds insult to injury. I was prepared to try to live with it but then more problems started cropping up.<br /><br />Next issue is the keyboard. At first it seemed okay but I am a very fast typist (90 wpm) and noticed that it was starting to miss keys. This became very frustrating as I use this as both a work and gaming laptop, and I couldn't type well when it was skipping keys. I don't know if this is a defect, or just because the keyboard is substandard, but if I typed slower, it didn't miss any keys. I type very heavily so I know it isn't me missing keys (plus my little Chromebook has no problems registering my keystrokes at full speed). Also, for a laptop marketing itself as a gaming laptop, I wish it would register more than 3 keys at once. For example, let's use a standard shooter. I'm holding down shift (sprint), w (forward movement), a (strafe left) and try to switch weapons really quick using 4. The keyboard maxes out at the original three keys and my attempt to hit the number 4 doesn't register. I know this is a hardware limitation rather than a defect, I just wish they got just a slightly higher quality keyboard.<br /><br />Last issue I have is with the touchpad. It's not terrible, as I used it without problems, but Acer seems to struggle with the gestures. (scroll up and down take a little distance to register, for example). Also, the surface is weird, and if your hands are just slightly moist (say you just washed your hands) it's really hard to use the trackpad. Other than that, it's accurate enough that I wasn't annoyed using it for web surfing, etc.<br /><br />I got it on sale for $600, but I would honestly admit that only IF I was guaranteed a 100% functioning unit would I ever consider purchasing this again.","3"

The right/left &#34;mouse&#34; buttons are a part of the tracking surface.  That means if you hover over a small image/link/button and press the button and slide your finger just a tiny bit while pressing, you will throw it off the place you wanted to select.  Most likely that will take you somewhere you didn't intend.<br />The pad is super sensitive, almost every time I move the mouse I end up clicking on an unintended link before I get to my destination.<br />This computer is useless without an external mouse.  It's too frustrating to use otherwise.<br />I won't even go into the horrors of Windows 8 and the inability to run programs unless you know their names.  I will be installing Ubuntu in the near future.","2"

I've built countless gaming systems for companies, friends, and for myself. I currently have a multi-monitor workstation that is worth $3,000. No, I am not bragging. I will touch base on why I mentioned it, in a moment. I've always wanted an ROG laptop, but I opted for desktops for more power & lower costs. This changed, after getting a job close to 50 miles each ways. After lugging my system a couple of times, I was done. Even with the Vengeance 70 LAN case. It's fantastic and sturdy, but I don't like the idea of lugging $3,000 worth of hardware in rush hour and Michigan's winter. So the solution is to buy a $1,000-2,000 laptop with a 4-year warranty (separate) for CAD & of course gaming. That way it is covered if something does happen. It was time to buy my dream laptop (the struggles). Razer's laptops were smaller, but hardly justifiable since it was unmoddable. Why pay $2,500 for a laptop that I can't add-on to later in the future?  When buying a laptop, your GPU and CPU come first. They are (somewhat) always permanent. You can always upgrade your RAM & HDD/SSD. I opted for this one, because of the 970m and I7 4710HQ. Yes I could have gotten the 128GB SSD for $250 more, but I can get a 500GB M500 SSD from Amazon for $175. Hardly justifiable for a tech-savvy guy like me.  My shipping/processing experience was HORRID with Amazon. I've never been mistreated by them before, but they didn't seem to care about why it took a week to get my laptop, and didn't use my Prime benefits like advertised.  I used the laptop the next day, and went on a 200 mile business trip. My buddy had the G75, so it was cool to compare systems with each other. When gaming in Arma III (CPU intensive game), I got 35 FPS on ultra. Great for that poorly-optimized game. I've seen others play BF4 on 120FPS. I'll test it this weekend. CAD is flawless. I can generate models within seconds. Better than my 4770K station I have at work.  The features,style, and being part of ROG is worth every penny. You will need the Nomad backpack. I bought that & the Gladiolus mouse. Both are exceptional. This laptop is 1/2 of a gaming workstation, yet works as good. Hmm... Physics?  Why are you still looking at the reviews? Did you buy it yet?!","10"

My use varies from basic web browsing, to video editing (gopro, cellphone, and basic video camera, nothing professional or crazy resolution), to gaming.<br /><br />I really like the backlit keyboard. Everything was easy to adjust to and I don’t find any issues with key size or placement. While I was concerned about this not having a dedicated “End” key – as I use that often when selecting text (shift+end to select a line) I did find that pressing shift+’end’ or numpad 1 functions as an end key. That said, jumping to the end of a line and selecting home works well enough – and still logs as ‘end’ if using a trainer or key capture software/use.<br /><br />Battery life was excellent out of the box, after a month of somewhat heavy use (cad & cam software on and off throughout 6 10 hour days a week) it still lasts like new. I was concerned with storage space but I’ve made due with an existing 3tb external drive that I easily get over 100mb/s speeds with. Out of the box it also came with a split partition 95gb to the OS and 130gb to data storage. I migrated my user account to the data portion and installed most of my not needed programs there (games) but kept my daily’s on the main partition (solidworks, gibbscam, photoshop, vegas, etc). Not sure if that has any impact, but I figure I would be uninstalling them anytime soon.<br /><br />The overall fit and finish has exceeded my expectations and I would say this is a very well built product. I am rough with it as I use it in a very clean machine shop, so it doesn’t just sit on a desk somewhere. The cooling system works very well – even while gaming with is sitting on my lap, on top of a comforter – which I know is a huge no-no but it stayed nice and cool nonetheless.<br /><br />I think the screen is nice enough and works well. In hind sight I think I would prefer a touch screen for my casual uses as another machine has that and is quite nice. The touchpad works nicely as well, however in quiet situations it does ‘rattle’ a bit and when clicking it does make a click sound. Not a deal breaker, just not a refined as the completely silent one on another machine.<br /><br />As for the smudge factor, I did carefully apply some speedy voc tire dressing with a rag and it does a phenomenal job at keeping the smudges invisible. I use the same on my phone and works well. Keeps everything a nice glossy finish where the smudges don’t stand out against the factory satin finish.<br /><br />Overall I would buy this laptop again – even for maybe $200 more.<br /><br />As for specs and the like, if you’re looking at this machine I’m sure you know what to expect hence why I didn’t mention them.","0"

I don't have any benchmarks to share because I simply don't care; everything I have fed it, it has eaten alive and spit out glass-smooth graphics. Anybody want to buy a used desktop? ;P<br /><br />If you forced me to say something bad about it, the only thing I could say is that the powerbrick is enormous and maybe the battery life isn't terrific. But what do you expect from a gaming machine?","1"

The specs were exactly the same. I chose Asus over upgraded version of msi, because i liked the design and also i felt the cooling technology is better in Asus. I received this laptop yesterday and i am very happy. I wanted to get a very good configuration laptop at a reasonable price. Within two days of placing the order, the price has dropped by around 23$. It is definitely worth it. I am running the laptop after detaching the battery :-)  When i ordered this laptop, there was only one review and it was hard to make a decision. But now, after i see many more 5 stars i feel my decision was right. I also received a nice gaming mouse. Though i prefer sleek mouse over a large one, still i liked it. I am not a game enthusiast, all i wanted was a quad core laptop i7, with 16gb ram ,SSD, backlit keyboard and good cooling. This is the best i could  find within the price range.  update (4/1/2015)  Attached the mouse pics. The volume of the speaker is very nice. I really liked the trackpad some very minor things which i didnt like:  There is no dedicated End button (had to use shift+ num 1 key in the num pad) Finger prints :-( right from the day i opened the laptop, finger print was clearly visible. The keyboard light doesnt come up unless we login. I have seen some posts regarding this in the internet. I would have preferred a caps lock light on the key itself rather than below the trackpad But i am not concerned about these, as these are just minor things.  i liked the feature of switching of the laptop screen  off (fn+ f7) without turning off the laptop, helps just in case you need to step aside for few minutes. TheOS is installed on the SSD and therefore the boot time is very fast. On full charge of the battery i am getting around 5 hours runtime.","153"

Overall, I'm satisfied with the laptop as a general work laptop and happy with the performance as long as I don't play games.  The only game I really try to run on it is World of Tanks, the graphics are great on the NVIDIA card, but this laptop just can't handle the heat.  Within 10 minutes of high quality graphics, the temperatures will hit max and shut the PC down, and this is on a 3 fan laptop cooler with the lid up and the display off, I use an external HDMI display.  With the graphics set to low, or with the NVIDIA card off and using the on board graphics, it will run.  I contacted Asus support and they were great and had me ship the laptop in, where they replaced the motherboard and reformatted the hard drive, and when it came back, it did the exact same thing.  I would not recommend this laptop for anyone that wants to play games, and I do not understand the other reviews that say they run them.","1"

The case is as good or better than name brand laptops I've owned or dealt with in the past. The touch pad/buttons took some getting use to. The mouse buttons are built into the touch (press the left or right side of the touch pad causing it to flex to get the mouse buttons to click) which made trying to click and drag confusing at first. I figured out the touch pad has multi-point touch capability so you click with one finger and drag with another instead of all with one finger.

To comment on some of the features, give some food for thought as they say, nothing more:the JBL speakers are VERY good, but for how beefy it is could have more bass to fill out the sound. The thing I'm finding most annoying is that there us no volume button that also doesn't require the pressing of the function key. The design is very straightforward, but I can't reach both with one hand. Minor offense. Battery life is excellent so far running it 100 - 0 I'm anywhere from 5-6 hours. There is lots of bloatware, but you'll get over that after to uninstall. Keys are a joy to type on. Windows 8.1 sucks, but hey, windows 10 is just around corner. for free.

I would not purchase another MSI laptop. [update 15Oct2015] This thing is still a constant reminder of how I wasted $1,000.00 plus dollars. Bluetooth still flakey, no BIOS updates - likey means support for it is over. Keyboard and mouse still terrible. Still ugly as sin. Still the killer of performance drivers thrashing my drive shortening it's lifesapn. (glad I didn't put an SSD in it since Killer OF Performance would wear it out.) Still terrible support site from MSI. Still no answer to the trouble ticket I set with their terrible support site. Still cheapo appearance. But perfect for simple gamers who have simple needs or those who want a glowy light on their laptop lid. [update 04Aug2015] My MSI Apache Pro has the Intel 3160 Dual Band Wireless AC Adapter. Another disappointment. This adapter causes all kinds of problems with WiFi dropping, bluetooth not working, and no amount of driver install and uninstall and reinstall and rebooting will fix it. What I've seen fix the issue from the Intel forums is replacing the wireless mini-pci adapter. Nice. If your WiFi drops a lot or gives terribly low throughput, then try disabling the bluetooth. After all, who needs bluetooth? Certainly not gamers. Their needs are very simple. As for me, I hate having to mess around troubleshooting a device that is supposed to work from day one, and I hate getting sub-par parts in anything, let alone a laptop. So I tried to contact MSI through their web site. During the day I work, and by the time I get home, it's too late to call. So a website contact form or email support is acceptable to me. However, the MSI support is still 404 (not working). Just as it was a month ago, and like it will continue to be next month. I did manage to create a trouble ticket for a motherboard. I just started selecting things at that point. Hopefully they will get back to me. But I sincerely doubt it. I'm going to try reinstalling - again - and following the precarious driver install method they outline on their web site. Aparethe whole ntly you have to get the MSI driver install &#34;just so&#34;. Imagine that. Imagine if Microsoft said you can only write a document in a specific order, and if you write the closing first, the whole document wont work. I have installed Dell laptop and desktop drivers in no particular order by iterating thoguh a folder full of drivers, with a for-loop calling pnputil and it works flawlessly. Not so here. (I know the lines above have some egregious typos. I gave up caring. The touchpad refuses to shut off while typing.) I really miss my Asus  [update 20Jun2015] This laptop features the Qualcomm &#34;Killer Performance Network Suite&#34;. They should call it the &#34;Killer OF Performance&#34; because all it seems to do for me is hammer away at my hard drive reading and writing to a file: C:\Program Data\Qualcomm\BWC.txt (This is a hidden\system folder in Windows so you may not even see it.) Anyway this Qualcomm app is for the Wired network card, and not the Wireless. I haven't even used a Wired connection yet. But guess what, the Killer OF Performance driver is logging every application that connects to the internet. Over, and over and over and over and over and over. Beating away at the hard drive for ZERO benefit. Why the Qualcomm Wired network driver needs to know anything relating to the Intel Wireless is beyond me. So MSI makes more work for the end user by including performance killing applications the user needs to remove. [end update]  [update July 19] So I want to protect my laptop since I'll be traveling, and I want to encrypt my drive. Windows 8.1  which comes with the laptop has no bitlocker, so I want to use truecrypt. Problem is that the laptop is GPT partition which truecrypt doesn't support. No problem I can reinstall windows as an MBR formatted volume and encrypt that. Problem I don't have an actual Windows 8.1 Install ISO or disk. I only have the all or nothing factory images. No problem, I'll open a ticket with MSI support and ask them. Problem - after spending too much time registering on their terrible support site, clicking the &#34;get support&#34; button in my product page takes me to a Page Not Found 404 error. Awesome. I guess I cannot be too mad, after all it is only 2015 and allowing customers to easily reach a corporation is a herculean technological feat these days. I still really hate the keyboard and touchpad. [end update]  Here's a list of a few grievances which I feel severely detract from the enjoyment of having this laptop. USB speeds are abysmal, especially in Windows.  The keyboard is loathsome to me. Some keys are odd sized, no dedicated Home and End keys, arrow keys mushed in with the rest of the keys. Even with the touchpad setting to &#34;off when typing&#34;, I still wind up typing all over the page. The DVD tray flies out of the unit as though it's a Bond Car ejection seat rocketing some villain into the upper atmosphere. Actually finding the DVD ejection button is an exercise in sublime finger gymnastics and timing. The touchpad, OMG!! This touchpad is so terrible that this alone is reason enough to avoid this laptop. Do not let your Mac friends see this touchpad. Ever. You will never live down the embarrassment.  Overall this laptop has a very cheap appearance when viewing it in person or when using it in person. It just doesn't feel like you spent almost 1,200 bucks. Instead it feels like you spent a whole lot less. It will always look cheap and dirty no matter what you do with it because A) It just plain looks cheap, B) it is a finger print magnet you will never be able to keep clean. Otherwise wear surgical gloves when using this laptop. Then it might stay clean. For comparison, my old Asus G73 was significantly finer in each area listed above, and cost me the same as this did back when I bought it many years ago. I had it for several years and it still looked great when I turned it back in after I left my job.  There are other issues as well, that technical oriented users may not appreciate, like severely limited bios, stupid quick boot with no messages. For regular use, these are annoyances and not always encountered on a daily basis. But when they are, you'll feel the frustration. Oh, and good luck guessing which key initiates the boot menu if you want to boot from USB or some other device. The display wont tell you, you'll have to hunt that tidbit down. So for me the boot screen can only serve as a reminder of which computer manufacturer I won't ever purchase from again.  While I'm stuck with this bad decision, you don't have to be. Look to Asus, or Dell, or HP instead or some other it brand. Really the touchpad is an epic fail. I cannot stress that enough. It's 2015 for crying out loud. Heck even my geriatric dad has a better touchpad on his Gateway laptop - yeah, Gateway.  So 2 stars for completely missing the mark on what a decent desktop replacement should be.","18"

After shopping around, I decided to go with this laptop.  Pros: - Screen is amazing.  Even running at 1920x1080, it blows away all other FullHD screens I own.  I compared Diablo 3, EVE Online, Heroes of the Storm, and a few other games side-by-side and this screen looks vastly superior (yes, both computers were using the &#34;ultra&#34; settings in game). - Heat displacement works.  After toying with buying a Razor, I noticed that every time I used one it would become incredibly hot underneath my fingers and on my legs.  I game on the couch next to my wife who is watching TV shows.  I need a laptop I can put on my lap and remain comfortable.  Their heat displacement really works.  This laptop is incredibly comfortable to use.  Cons: - The graphics card can't keep up with 4k.  Moving back down to FullHD was a fine choice for me.  There is non-4k version of this computer coming out and I probably would have preferred to get that. - It is a bit loud.  The fans keep it incredibly cool, but noisier than normal.","26"

Really this is a truly great investment for the perfect gamer. Essentially, this thing will... will manifest inside the core minds of your friends minds. Making them think about how beast of a machine YOU have and then they will look at there low tier rigs and say, &#34;WHY CAN'T YOU BE LIKE HIS PC!&#34;<br /><br />First and foremost this is a very striking and visual appealing piece of hardware and from the front, it will draw peoples attention. LED's cover this thing all over the place front, screen (logo), keyboard, and below the speakers. Each of these sections can be interacted with and the color can change within the dedicated software app that is built in. (Rocking a pink and blue breathing effect)<br /><br />The keyboard is very tactile and is easy on response times for typing. It also has 5 dedicated macro keys for on the go programming as well. (Final Fantasy 14 player here..) The track pad though feels rather small for me and something bigger would have been helpful but it is a just a tiny con.<br />The speakers for this laptop (or any laptop) I've used thus far are good, there is some bass and it makes the whole entertainment aspect much more better as a whole.<br /><br />(Not going into too much technical specs) The overall performance of this laptop is great, really great! You are paying for the top of the line premium product. 4k, a top grade graphics card (GTX 970m), and touch screen. Those are my selling points because there is so much use for each aspect. A built in 4k monitor that Alienware has done for the first time and succeeded with flying colors! Hook up this bad boy up to a 4k monitor and bam! 4k gaming (to a point). GTX 970m graphics card can run most triple A title games at 60FPS Max settings no problem and 4k at a reasonable FPS that wont make you tank yourself. The touch screen is also an overall nice feature because I find my self tapping the screen more than using the keyboard and if you get this laptop you will understand!<br /><br />Conclusion:This peripheral will literally bring shame to those rigs at your local LAN party and you will have this very evil smirk when you whip this out of nowhere... Literally.<br />The laptop is fantastic and for the price you are getting the top of the line next gen graphics card and raw power to last you a couple years..

I carry the laptop around quite a bit and after awhile I noticed that the charger that came with it was starting to intermittently stop working.The problem was the cord coming out of the box and heading to the laptop. I priced out buying a new charger from ASUS and it was very expensive and due to the fact that the first one I got was acting up I had a feeling that if I purchased another one from ASUS I would end up with the same problem eventually. So I looked around on Amazon and found this item. I works perfectly, just as you would expect a adapter to do so of course. But it also has a couple of features that I would say make it even better than the one that came from ASUS. First it has a power indicator light, when it is receiving power it has a small noticeable light (I say noticeable because yeah you see the light. This is great because you know that it's plugged into the wall, and that cord from the wall is properly connected to the box also. The other feature that I adore is that the overall length of the cord is wonderful. It's longer than what ASUS gives you; but it is not a ridiculously insane length. I've had the cord for awhile now and frankly I have yet notice even a hint of wear anywhere on it. Great product, great features and a great price.","1"

I don't know if it's a result from me accidentally dropping it and breaking off the two USB ports (I had an external HHD plugged in at the time) on the left side.  I plan on taking it apart to see if I can fix it by cleaning it out (probably has dust and crap in it from the 2 deployments it's been with me).  It was also plugged in when the house took a direct lightning strike which fried quite a few of my electronics but the laptop survived!<br /><br />Now the Review:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fast!<br />IPS screen<br />Keyboard<br />4 USB3 ports<br /><br />Cons:<br />The touchpad arrived with the bottom right corner sticking up.  (I was able to press it back down but it took a little more force than I would've liked)<br /><br />Packaging:  The packaging was as expected (based on the other 2 Asus laptops I've bought).  However, I was puzzled as to why they even bothered to put one single packing sheet between the laptop box and the shipping box.  It did nothing to add cushioning and was only on the top and nowhere else.<br /><br />Inside is a cleaning pad, 4 extra HHD screws, a cable tie, AC adapter (Delta Electronics branded) and a basic warranty sheet.  All the components are neatly tucked away.  The laptop itself comes in a soft lint-free white pouch.<br /><br />First boot/Set-up:  You need an internet connection (or call Microsoft via phone) to activate windows, otherwise, the OS will continue to remind you every time you reboot and/or enter any of the control panel tools.  Additionally, you need to activate to customize your profile.  I only mention this because I don't have an internet connection at the moment (I'm currently deployed and don't feel like spending additional money on a second WiFi access card).  It took approximately 24 seconds for the OS to completely boot up.<br /><br />HDD upgrade to SSD:  The SATA III HDD that came installed in the left bay (master) in my particular laptop is made by HGST which is a branch of Western Digital.  I used the SSD Migration tool from Samsung (I downloaded the latest version--using my other laptop--from their web site as opposed to using the disc provided).  It was a simple process and the OS recognized the SSD after the second reboot.  I swapped drives knowing that the right bay is only SATA II.  Once I verified the laptop was booting from the SSD, I installed Samsung Magician and configured using the performance setting SSDs.  Now the laptop only takes 6-7 seconds to cold boot!  I reinstalled the original HDD into the right bay and repartitioned the drive to have roughly equal capacity using the disc management snap-in.<br /><br />I'm still in the process of installing all my programs and games and I'll update this review after I get the chance to play some of the games (BF3, Diablo II).","0"

I mainly use it for gaming as it comes with Nvidia GTX 765M which is one of the best laptop cards for gaming. The only downside was Windows 8 which is not suitable for games at all. It never shows the capabilities of this beast, so I had to get rid of it and install an Ultimate Windows 7 version which showed the great performance of this machine. It rocked in all games.. I played the following games in maximum graphics with no lags or stuttering:<br />&#34;Fifa 15, Mass Effect, Ghost Raider, Mortal Kombat X, and many others&#34;.. I just wanna say it is a beast not a laptop. If you are looking for an awesome laptop for games, mainly, You definitely should go for this one. It is quite heavy, but it ain't a problem for me carrying it around. Best gaming laptop for money.","0"

While I could leave it at that, I'll go into a tad bit more detail. I could leave a review that says exactly what every other review says, but if you're like me you want a review to address the discrepancies found in the other reviews. That is exactly what I aim to do.<br /><br />I've seen three big things that seem to stand out as negatives for this PC:<br />1. The screen: I was pleasantly surprised. The screen is of incredibly good quality, no dots of course. The viewing angles are brought up again and again but really aren't bad. Definitely no worse than any other laptop I've used, and some may argue that it could be better. Completely a non-issue.<br />2. The speakers: Lots of people have complained about these speakers but I am extremely confused as to why. The speakers I received on my laptop (Purchased June 2015) are hands down the best speakers I've heard on a laptop. Crystal clear quality. I'm thinking that the older reviews may have been receiving different speakers as a part of this build. 9/10 because bass could be a bit better.<br />3. The finish: people have talked about the matte finish being a fingerprint magnet. It is also a dust magnet, hair magnet, and scratches easily. That being said, I use a microfiber cloth and this quickly becomes a non-issue. Even without it, the computer itself makes it tolerable. The included picture shows the surface with a distinctive hand print I just made by closing the laptop.<br /><br />Conclusion: amazing computer for an amazing price. Ssd is insane. Computer goes off to on in 1.4 seconds.","6"

My 17 inch laptop with an 860m (from asus) gets more FPS (frames per second) doing the same exact thing, not by much but it does get more. Furthermore if you will notice on graphics card benchmarks This card preforms slightly worse than the 860m   This is a great Laptop if your looking for something that is smaller than a 17 inch laptop, and more mobile. However This is NOT the laptop for you if you intend to use it stock and are not going to at least do a fresh install of windows. I have heard that the motherboard has a free windows 8.1 key imbedded in it, so in theory all you need is a windows 8.1 install disc. I own Two ASUS RoG laptops, and as with MOST ASUS RoG laptops they suffer from some defects for example BSOD (blue screen of death) this can be negated with a lot of goggling and some time. It comes pre installed with bloat ware and useless things That Hinder the performance or in some cases flat out make games UN-playable by causing a sort of &#34;turning lag&#34;. I downloaded world of Warcraft and installed it on the ssd (stock win 8.1 installed), it ran at about 30 to 40 fps sitting in the garrison.   Now the part i am most proud of, after 15 hours of setup and troubleshooting and a few weeks of testing  i successfully installed windows 7 64 bit ultimate on this laptop's SSD and HD And it is stable!! so any one saying that it cannot be done, is just wrong and didn't put the time in to tweak there 1000 dollar computer which is pretty stupid. That being said it was very annoying.   -----------------------------Things you have to do to install windows 7 ----------------------------- • go in the Bios and play with settings until you can see the drive you want to install win 7 (remove safe boot i think) Google around if you care. • Remove GPT part-ion style when it tells you that you cant install windows 7 on the drive (threes a youtube video, Please note that you will have to press the command multiple times.... i had to do it about 30 times before the command prompt finally popped up See[...] •Find all the right drivers. Now i would like to elaborate on this, every piece of hardware in this computer HAS a windows 7 driver for it. If you know whats is in the computer you know where to find your drivers, getting  programs that will find and update your drivers automatically is a waste of money and wont work, so don't bother with it, again Google is your friend. •now that you spent 6 hours finding all your drivers (that pesky lan driver took me a very long time, by the way you can get it from the manufacturers website (of the card) (however it is not really clear on what you need.) you can now proceed to update your drivers (graphics card) note*** some of the drivers for win 8.1 on the ASUS website do work for win 7 and in some cases even have a win 7 version included in the folder!! so download them all and look for the 64 bit folder! By the way I DID NOT flash the bios, i felt it was unnecessary if everything was stable and added a risk of possibly making things not work. [...]SLanguage=en&m=GL551JW&p=3&s=715&os=41&hashedid=R4vSQaqnQNiUWK4p • once you have tweaked all your settings for max performance, your fps will be increased by i would say 20 to 50 depending on what your doing. (don't forget to put the laptop on high performance mode by clicking the battery setting)  for me it was sitting in the garrison on world of Warcraft.   -----------------------------some more things ----------------------------- Once installing win 7 on my HD, i had to jump through the same hoops installing it on the SSD, for one, you need CC cleaner to wipe the SSD, my nuke program wouldn't work. So in other words... for me, i had to have a OS installed on the HD so i could wipe the SSD. After doing this i had more problems with hard drives not showing up on boot up. it seemed at first after installing win 7 on my data drive (1 TB HD) i needed the win 7 OS install disc to boot onto the win 7 i installed on the SSD. there is a solution to this on the same section in bios settings, enable it and you can choose between your win 7 drives on boot up, thus negating the need to keep a win 7 install disc in your computer. So hopefully now you have windows 7 64 bit ultimate installed on both your 1 TB HD and your SSD, with drivers fully updated on both.  -----------------------------Things you should be made aware of----------------------------- •960m is really a 860m (as stated above) • you can install windows 7 with some work. • the more expensive version with a SSD has a removable battery (I don't know about the other version) • the SSD is internal, however the laptop can be opened up by a professional to upgrade the SSD if you want to void warranty • Laptop likes to collect finger prints • The back light in the ISP screen version of this laptop at least, could be brighter, however I'm sure you will get use to it. • Ethernet port is upside down and is not full size however expands to fit a full size, just imagine it has a jaw that opens up... kinda annoying. • My girlfriend says she has a hard time typing with they keyboard and misses keys, however i believe she is just not use to her new laptop yet, as i have not had that problem.   -----------------------------Ranting -----------------------------   Like i said it took 15 hours to get this laptop to preform to my satisfaction, (Goggling, tweaking, installing and weeks of testing to make sure win 7 was stable). I would have never bought a laptop that was not a 17 inch because first off, i like big laptops, i have access to BOTH Hard drive bays and It seems to have slightly better performance. The cooling system is also better on the ASUS RoG G750, unlike this one. Cooling system is still good, just not as good as the G750 with the dedicated GPU fan, Blowing Hot air out the back and not onto whatever you put to the left side of your laptop. However i bought this for my girlfriend and after setting it up i believe it was worth the money, however i don't enjoy being lied to about what the 960m really is, or how hard they made it to install what i wanted.   I do recommend a cooling plate for this laptop, because its just a good idea and there cheap, however you don't really need one. The cooling system is good, and Much MUCH better than other big name laptops (MSI) ect. You can run a dk2 (oculus rift) sort of lol... since this is a 960m, and my 860m does meh ruining one its SHOULD BE pretty similar... just don't expect to play Elite dangerous for the gaming experince... and you will get a lot of judder, but some demos are quite playable!! You should consider just running it off a high end gaming desktop. if you choose to buy one know that win 7 is probably going to be mandatory. If your developing software for VR this might work for you....MIGHT.  If this review was the most helpful review every for this laptop leave a comment and let me know! i can always use an ego boost! Also i don't mind answering a few questions either","11"

I bought it because of its affordable price for a gaming laptop, and came with come good hardware. My review is as follows:<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - HDD+SSD combo starts up quick (about 8 seconds for me, but I block or delete a lot of startup programs)<br /> - Solid CPU and GPU for the price (I run Elder Scrolls on ultra-high settings with good framerate (50+), But it must be plugged in for those results)<br /> - Great look in a solid case. Material is pretty durable.<br /> - Screen has decent color for gaming, but not quite editing quality. Good Anti-glare matte screen<br /> - Back lite keypad looks good and has multiple settings<br /> - Comes with a portable optical drive<br /> - Nice speakers for a laptop<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Gets a little hot when running games with high graphics. CPU cores average 76 C<br /> - LOTS of initial bloatware, some is malware prone.  Get rid of it as quickly as possible!<br /> - The top of the laptop is a fingerprint magnet<br /> - Keypad could be a hair more to the right. Accidentally tap it...a lot!<br /> - No sound cancel button. Not a big deal, but they're nice to have.<br /><br />I did a TON of research on which laptop I should buy for under $1,000. I lucked out and got this for $850 brand new and it was worth every penny so far. All the pros significantly out weigh the cons for me.  I would recommend this to a friend, and I have.  If for any reason my opinion of this laptop changes I will be sure to retract my statements. But until then this has been the best laptop I have ever owned!","1"

If you're looking for a sleek and pretty little laptop, don't. This won't impress your marketing friends, this one is made for performance!!!<br />Would recommend this to all my friends!","0"

Should have heeded the negative reviews","I bought this computer to replace my 18&#34; Toshiba Qosmio. A few friends of mine have ROG computers and assured me that they were awesome gaming laptops. I was already skeptical. So I read all the reviews here on Amazon and decided to give it a chance since the positive outweighed the negative. Well, everything seemed in working order when I set up the computer. I only used it for a week before it started acting up. I had only installed Origin, Steam, uPlay, etc. Didn't get a chance to install any of my games to decide whether or not it was a competent gaming computer. My use of this computer only consisted of brief 30-60 min internet access. At the beginning of the second week, the laptop went to sleep in the middle of me using it. Just clicked off. I shrugged it off and hit the power button - it was just as I'd left it, so maybe I hit a button? No. For the next five days it would continue to just shut off randomly while I was using it. The computer was either plugged in or fully charged, and was not overheated or anything. I tried restarting the computer a few times. That didn't fix the problem. Pretty soon, it got to the point where I couldn't trust the damn thing to stay on for longer than 5 minutes at a time. Unfortunately I sold my old computer within the first week of owning this one so I'm without a laptop entirely. Since there were so many similar issues with this laptop, I decided not to bother with getting a replacement. Just returned it and got a full refund. Will not try another ROG computer again.","3"

It could play games like League of Legends on max graphics without problems, though as games get more and more advanced, this laptop will find itself becoming obsolete.

There are outlets everywhere nowadays too, so I never found myself with a dead laptop.<br /><br />If you're looking for a slightly outdated, but still powerful gaming rig that you can easily transport, this is the laptop for you.

I solved this problem by just using a USB laptop cooler which you don't really need to plug it in just let the fans on the bottom breath so it stays nice and cool.  Using it on a bed, or some place that doesn't allow those fans to breath will quickly bring your temps up.  Easily not a problem on a table top, or again with a elevated flat surface so those fans can get air.<br />  Doesn't have Thunderbolt 2/3 or even USB-C  Maybe next years model will?","1"

Bloatware was easily removed, Office and Antivirus was transferred, drivers updated, and all my Steam games are on. One thing that bothers me still is the high DPC latency. Every fix I attempted does not affect the intermittent bursts of static every few seconds/minutes. It's extremely annoying. I'm considering sending it back for a replacement but need to have it back soon for school.<br /><br />I suspect it's due to a faulty motherboard or some other hardware issue. Judging by the other reviews I knew there was a degree of risk when getting this laptop so I was not too distraught to learn about this. At least this was the issue, but I would like to see it gone soon.<br /><br />Other issues I was able to resolve:<br /><br />By default the computer was using the integrated Intel GPU instead of the Nvidia GPU. You can change this in the &#34;manage 3d settings&#34; section of the Nvidia control panel<br /><br />Updating the OS often corrupted my games and caused them to crash often. Reinstalling was a bit of a pain but it's nothing to cry about.","0"

I want to share my experience with one of the vendors (RockGo ).They were the cheapear option at the time and  I contacted them about their return policy since I read a few bad comments about them and wanted to be protected on my purchase. However after they replied to my email (with a rather non-descriptive policy) suddenly they were not selling the product anymore. (Red flag?). A few hours later they reposted the laptop at a much higher price. I wonder if what could have happened to me if I had bought it without asking. Probably a bad experienxe bases on their negative comments. So be careful when buying from this seller.<br /><br />I ended up buying it from another seller and everything was good. The laptop itself has a very nice display. The first I did was to install windows 10. Then I uninstalled many of the ASUS bloatware that came with the laptop. It really boots very fast in like no more that 5 seconds thanks to the SSD. The laptop came wi the 4 useable partitions. 2 of them a split of the SSD and the other 2 of the HDD.","12"

So this summer I decided that I would get a gaming laptop and take that with me to college instead of packing my desktop with two monitors. I shopped around tons, looking from Razer, to MSI, to Gigabyte. However, just last week I came across Eluktro and to be honest I brushed them off at first due to the fact that I never heard of them as they are obviously not one of the bigger names in gaming laptops. After seeing the fact that many laptops were going for 2000$ or more for a 970m, i7, at least 8 gb of ram, and a decent amount of hard drive space, I looked at this laptop more and seen that this model I own has a 970m, 1080p IPS screen, 16gb RAM, 250gb SSD, and a good i7, all for 1450$, I took the leap of faith and went and ordered the system. I ordered the system Sunday night, and received the system Wednesday. The package was super protected, the laptop was in 3 boxes with padding around each box.  When I first laid my eyes on the system I was honestly shocked. The quality of the laptop is freaking amazing. It really feels like a premium product. The system is wayyyyy slimmer than what I thought it was going to be, which amazing due to the fact that they have put in a very powerful geforce 970m graphics processor in this! Couple that with an i7, and 16gb of ram, and you have one incredibly powerful system for a way cheaper price than what other laptop makers are offering.  There are many pros to this laptop. The keyboard feels amazing to type on and has a clean white back-light on it. The screen is very bright and vibrant and also has a matte finish which is really good for Pc gamers as there will not be any glare when playing your games. The system is actually very quiet for a gaming laptop, and when gaming, there has not been any overheating or anything of that sorts. The speakers is what really surprised me, the sound on this thing is so good, obviously not as good as a 5.1 speaker system, or a pair of gaming headphones, but for laptop speakers, they are some of the best that I have ever heard! Another thing I like about this laptop is that it is not flashy at all. Most gaming laptops are covered in flashy LED's or fancy graphics, this does not, it is a very clean looking laptop, and is something that I would be comfortable with bringing into the classroom and people won't be looking at it funny.  There are a lot of good things about this laptop, but everything isn't perfect, and with this laptop, there are a few things. One being the screen. While very bright and really sharp considering it is an IPS panel (which is amazing), mine came with a little dead pixel that you can only see under certain light. I am not sending my unit back considering it is a small thing and is very hard to notice unless you really try to look for it. Another thing is that the screen has a lot of flex to it, which again, is no problem for me considering I do not touch the screen and have to animals that can damage the screen. I would have preferred a matte finish below the keyboard instead of the brushed aluminum to reduce fingerprints also. The touch pad is nice, and I love the fact that it has to separate buttons for left and right click, however the clicks feel mushy, I would have preferred a much more clickier button if that makes sense. However I use a razer gaming mouse so that doesn't matter to me much.  In conclusion, I think this laptop is easily the best value for what you can get on the market. I even ordered another 1tb hard drive, for only 50$, which brings my total to 1500$ for a laptop that many of the bigger companies would charge 2300$ or more for. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a portable gaming laptop!","7"

It's an issue with the BIOS Version(A02 it ships with).<br /><br />  Downgrading to the older A00 Bios version apparently fixes the problem(apparently they used to have a decent fan profile going), but the 180 watt power supply poses a problem-  The video card requires more then that much power to hit peak performance- this problem was fixed in version A02 of the bios which is sett to pull the power required in excess of what the power supply can put out directly from the battery- so Address the fan issue by downgrading to A00 will mean a loss in overall performance.  If you get a version of the laptop with a 240 watt power supply this won't be an issue and you can just downgrade to A00(though to do so you'll need to order directly from Dell as the amazon 15 inch has 180 watt supply)<br /><br />The Solution most people opt for(in fact the dell service reps have basically told us to just do this rather then expect a fix in the next version of the Bios) is to us HWinfo to manually control the fan speeds(which some people may consider a pain).  Also, while I've been told the newest beta supports the new AW laptops, so far I haven't been able to get HWinfo to actually display the fan controls window(only been on it for a few hours now so I may still get it to work).<br /><br />Again though my actual experience has been great, which is why I give the computer 4 stars- I've had no loss of performance, The only reason I'm at all concerned about this issue is the idling temperatures feel worrying in regards to how long this laptop will last without a fix.","1"

I was looking to purchase a computer that could handle photo and video editing (adobe photoshop and premier pro). I liked the idea of having something that was portable, which is generally hard to find without severely compromising on specs. I've been using the laptop for about a month now.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Super fast<br />- No weird crashing issues<br />- Lightup keyboard is a nice, added bonus<br />- Fan does a very good job at keeping the laptop cool, all things considered<br />- Absolutely no pre-installed bloatware<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Heavy, large (not a big fan of the number pad on the laptop; if anybody really needed it they could get a usb numberpad)<br />- Gamer tag all over &#34;Republic of Gaming&#34;<br />- Operating system comes pre-installed on the hdd instead of the SSD (come on, the one thing that comes pre-installed and the one thing that you specifically want on the SSD)<br /><br />Overall comments: This is a solid laptop for video and photo editing and everything in between. Although it's a bit large and definitely not the lightest laptop, it's a steal for the price. Sure, you may get a sleeker, lighter laptop from Apple, but you'll pay double the price and not have all of the specs. It's kept up with all of my editing work, only running into issues when working with ~20min, 1080p, 30fps clips that are condensed down to ~1min (timelapses). It has a bit of trouble handling these in premier, but I also haven't tried messing around with settings to see if I can remedy it.","0"

COMPUTER.","I am IN LOVE with my Lenovo y50 touch screen. I HATE Windows however, so I dual booted Linux OS Ubuntu 14.04.<br /><br />At first, I was pretty discouraged because many programs are not updated to scale with the 4k screen. For example, MATLAB and TeXStudio. But the next versions of these two programs are supposed to have scaling options to fix this issue. An easy solution was to reduce the resolution of the screen in Ubuntu. I was able to scale everything perfectly in Ubuntu.<br /><br />I have customized my Ubuntu using Compiz to get the 3D cube desktop which is REALLY FUN with the touch screen. People are very impressed with how futuristic my computer appears. I also have Delorean Dark Theme and wobbly windows from Compiz.<br /><br />The mouse buttons frustrated me at first until I realized that you DON'T NEED THEM. You can double tap the pad for &#34;right click&#34; and single tap for &#34;left click.&#34; Now I love this mouse.<br /><br />The red glowing keys is phenomenal. It really does enhance the overall experience.<br /><br />I personally do not play video games so I cannot comment on that. I just use it for research and school and it's great.<br /><br />The one downside is the short battery life. It only lasts about 2-4 hours :/. But still worth it in my opinion. But I do want to slap Lenovo in the face for not at least offering an updated battery option. Psh.<br /><br />Overall, I love it obviously.","2"

Meaning all data with it had been lost (Fortunately for me, I back up my data religiously)<br />I had to refund my customer. ehh oh well. Like i said, i am not new to hardware so I know hardware dies from time to time.<br />Not normally after a month life span but ehh what evs. My patience was more the reasonable considering the scenario.<br />I quickly found in my research that I was not alone, (GOOGLE ASUS SSD ISSUES) that ASUS uses cheap and faulty hardware for even their premium laptops. STRIKE ONE (Id still give 4 stars)<br />I had just missed my return timeline, so I had to turn to ASUS customer service. This is where the real problem began.<br />After holding for 30 minutes I had saved the service desk time and effort by quickly giving them the error and the actually cause.<br />I had an RMA ticket generated and was told i would be shipped an empty box with a paid for return label.<br />A week later, still no box. STRIKE TWO (Crap happens, fix my product and ill feel fair giving 3 stars)<br />I called ASUS again, and after holding for another 30 minutes + they told me they do not supply a return box for in-warranty items. Oh, okay....<br />So I asked am I responsible for paying for the shipping materials? The technician answered by explaining the shipping was paid for, I just had to slap this sticker on the box with the laptop in it and drop of at any fedex location. So in other words yes, I am responsible for both the box and the packaging cost to take advantage of my already paid for warranty ($10). It was at this point I began to become frustrated with ASUS. I requested my return shipping be expedited due to me falling threw the cracks originally. Did I mention this $1300 laptop is a MONTH OLD.<br />The technician said he would &#34;try&#34; I asked to speak with a supervisor, not to make a scene, get a refund or free products, but only to have my machine fixed promptly since this is a new machine and i have already waited a week.<br />I was placed on hold again for the supervisor and then ASUS disconnected me. STRIKE THREE (I would never recommend ASUS or any of their products)<br />There are simply two type of business strategy's in this world, the kind that set the tone and deliver excellent customer service, and then there are those that just simply do not care. ASUS is the later.<br />You can fix hardware, but you cant fix bad business.<br />You can buy this product and &#34;hope&#34; this does not happen to you, and you'll be happy if it does not. BUT IF IT DOES, YOU WILL BE MISERABLE with your purchase.<br />I will be sending my ASUS laptop back, hopefully ill have it back within the next month. I wont place my expectations to high.<br />cheap hardware, even worse customer service.","2"

Updated","Updated- Issue was resolved. Have had the laptop for about a month now, and it is great!  The fan is a bit loud and the laptop does get kind of close to being hot when playing games.  I've also experienced lag while playing Starcraft 2 when I try to run on max settings, which is odd because my research indicated that it should be able to handle SC2 without any problems at all.  Other than that, the laptop itself is great, although I do find myself wishing there were dedicated keys to handle the volume instead of having to hit FN and the volume key.  So, if the laptop is that great, why the one star?  When I purchased this laptop there was a $100 mail in rebate from MSI.  You get the UPC, mail it in with an application and a copy of the invoice and they're supposed to send you a $100 American Express card.  When you go to apply for the rebate, they let you know that it will take several months for them to send you the AMEX card, but if you agree to a $9 deduction from the rebate, they will send it sooner.  That's ridiculous, but whatever, I'll lose out on $9 to get it while I still remember I'm supposed to. I mailed in my application right away triple checking to make sure I have all of required documents.  A few days later I get an email from MSI saying my application was denied because I was missing the copy of the invoice.  BS.  When you check your status they let you check a PDF including scanned images of the documents that you have sent in.  My invoice is there, and it is even stamped.  I call MSI and the representative I spoke with says, &#34;We could not accept the invoice because the top does not clearly say Final Details.&#34; BS. I know for a fact that EVERYTHING on the invoice is legible as I printed it out myself.  The only reason why it was not clearly legible on the scanned file was because their scan quality sucks and the words Final Details are in a lighter font. Representative still asks me to email them a copy of my invoice.  Fine.  She also asks me to call 3 business days later to check to see if they received it... Fine.  So I do just that, representative tells me that because it's a different department that checks the emails I have to wait a few more days and check the website and see IF they update my claim.  It has been 11 days since I emailed them my invoice and still nothing.  I just sent them another email as their phone lines are not available on the weekends.  Maybe I'm just having bad luck with MSI's customer service but if getting a refund that they were promoting is so difficult, I don't even want to think about what a warranty claim is going to be like.  I will update this review once my issue is hopefully resolved.","3"

"B00TDENEPC","Razer Blade RZ09-01301E22-R3U1 14-Inch Gaming Laptop","1","2015-08-22","I'm sad to say that I'm done with Razer, or ""How to have truly rotten customer service""","As a long time fanboy and consumer of Razer products (having bought several $100+ peripherals from them), I am extremely disappointed with their execution on this product.  I purchased this machine because of the amazing reviews it has received both here and on Newegg. After comparing it to other options (notably the Asus G501) and despite the extra 1000$ I would pay over the competition, I decided that this laptop would be worth it because previous Razer products have been so awesome. The machine I received is incredible. It's light weight, fast, and comfortable to use. The laptop has great track pad, beautiful display, great graphics abilities, etc. From a technical and use standpoint, it's awesome.  After having the machine a couple weeks, I started to notice that the machine fans were a bit over-zealous. While not doing anything, the fans would suddenly fire up to max speed and run for several minutes before calming down. When I say &#34;not doing anything,&#34; I mean the laptop was sitting idle (i.e. not even internet browsing) while I was watching TV or playing games on my PS4. When I fired up a game, the fans would kick into high gear instantaneously. The fans were even blasting at full speed when I'd watch YouTube videos at 480. And yes, I was using the machine on a reasonable surface (e.g. sitting on a desk with nothing underneath or blocking the fans).  I started to get concerned so I downloaded HWMonitor. After firing up a game (pretty much any game) on lowest settings, the CPU (not GPU) temperature would jump to 90+ C. That is way too high for a CPU. I further tested this by leaving HWMonitor on while the computer was idle (I turned off any and all applications, so it was only running Windows). Apparently being idle was enough to set the CPU temperatures soaring up to 90+ C. Clearly I received a defective machine.  At this point the laptop was over the 30 day return policy, so I contacted Razer over the matter. They happily said they would issue an RMAand repair the machine. The whole process was fairly easy, and they said they fixed it by replacing the motherboard. The problem is they didn't fix anything. The machine was in the exact same state as it was when I sent it down to them.  At this point, I'm shocked and appalled with Razer. How on Earth this machine left their facilities in the first place is baffling to me. I'm astonished they managed to not even fix the issue after I told them what was wrong. How do you &#34;repair&#34; a 2700$ machine and not even check if the issue has actually been fixed? If this were a 50$ mouse, I'd be annoyed, but that's it. Instead, this is an incredibly expensive machine that I've been researching and debating over buying for several months. I'm absolutely furious over Razer's complete failure in this situation.  I'm sad, disappointed, and furious about the situation. I've contacted them again over this, but any result will still leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I've been a loyal fanboy for the last 8 years having hardly paid attention to peripherals from their biggest competition, and it'll be rather sad parting. Alas, I suppose 8 years is longer than most celebrity weddings, so at least there's that...  (Edit) An update: After contacting Razer about the still-broken machine, they more-or-less told me, &#34;Too bad,&#34; and proceeded to write a long advertisement to me about the machine. A snippet:  &#34;...Here is what out CEO has said about the thermal design:  One of the questions I've been getting is: The Blade has the same performance/power as other systems which are twice the thickness/weight - how have we managed to design in so much power without the system overheating?  Well, we've got pretty much some of the most talented thermals engineers in the world here at Razer and it's really based on 2 really incredible major innovations...&#34;  Yes, that is straight from the email they sent me. Consider this a review as a warning. If you purchase this product, be sureto put it through it's paces in the first few days to uncover any failures. If there are any issues, return it immediately for a new one as Razer will refuse to fix it.","28"

It supports my laptop(which is 17&#34; and weighs 2.8kg) pretty firmly, the adjustable stand is covered by soft pads so it grabs the surface well. The front baffle plate which holds the laptop also has a soft pad so it won't scratch the laptop. The downside is that its made of plastic so might not last long.<br /><br />The fans blow cool airs efficiently, without making noticeable noise. Even in maximum speed, my ears need to be pretty close to hear the fans. It is definitely more quite than the CPU or video card cooler in a typical desktop, which is a big plus because I can turn it on without being reminded it is there running.<br /><br />It comes with a USB cable which can be used to connect to the laptop and draws power from the laptop. But I prefer to use a USB AC adapter so the battery life can be longer.<br /><br />Overall, the cooling pad does its job pretty well, and I particularly like the quietness of the fans.","1"

Junk it from the start. It is one of the absolute worst displays I have seen on a laptop in a very long time. Instead pick up a LG PHILIPS LP156WF4(SP)(D1) to replace BAM! FIXED! If you are hesitant to do this yourself there are videos to walk you through it, Very easy!<br /><br />Now the main bottleneck on speed for this laptop lies solely on the hybrid HDD/SSD running at a mind numbing 5400rpm. The load time for this laptop stock was a few minutes easy and the first time I set it up I thought it was DOA with how long it took just to get to the first registration screen. Basically start this bad boy up go fix some lunch, eat it, do some laundry come back and it should be done. Fix this issue by snagging a nice SSD (don't forget your SATA to USB cable) and immediately clone the HDD right after registration to your SSD. This will save so much frustration you don't even realize.<br /><br />Once completing these first 2 tweaks costing under $200 now you have yourself a mean machine. The display pops, the laptop will load in less than 10 seconds, your frame rates are not throttled by that measly 5400rpm  HDD drive and you are gaming hard at high graphical settings. With the new SSD you may also want to get a laptop cooling pad as the Nvidia 860M GTX is a horse and will be working harder now that you can game at higher settings thanks to that SSD.","0"

The main thin that sets this laptop apart from others is its amazing cooling system and its price tag. However there are several major problems with this laptop. The first is that the 256gb SSD it comes with come with a partition. This partition allocates the majority of the memory away from the operating system meaning it limits the amount of programs you can run unless you want to use third party software to shift programs across the partition. There isn't enough space to begin with for gamin on the SSD. The partition makes it near impossible.<br /><br />The second issue is the drivers on the computer. The default drivers are incorrectly implemented and will frequently cause a blue screen with the error message driver_power_state_failure. From what i can tell this has to do with the integrated graphics drivers competing with the nvidia drivers. The uniqueness of the drivers makes them near impossible to replate and the problme extremely difficult to fix.<br /><br />If you want a laptop you can just plug and play this is not your choice. If you want a laptop that has the best specs for this price range and you don't mind putting a lot of work into it there is no better choice. ( ASUS please fix your driver issues and stop partioning extremely small SSD/HDD with out consumer input)","10"

Here is pro and cons. First what I do like - it boot up blazing fast, amount of boatware was minimal, performance met all expectations and exceed them. I'd say this is best gaming laptop for it's price. I like a lot fact that this machine fully customizable by experienced user - easy to assemble and dissemble. It have replaceable battery (huge plus). Keyboard is nice but I hate fact that symbols are red colored - hence impossible to see them in the dark. Because manual is somewhat poorly written it is not transparent how to turn on backlit illumination of keyboard. Other thing which more inconvenience rather real bad thing - default configuration of video CPU (it set on automatic) - hence it need to reset to the NVidia. Another inconvenience is preinstalled AV - MacAfee (not a big deal again). Battery life is fairly short - I'd say 3.5 hours at most from the full charge and this is just for internet browsing not gaming. Power consumption can be tweaked but at cost of performance. Video panel is TN not the IPS but this understandable giving the price - to bad there were no option to by this laptop with IPS. All in all this is excellent choice of gaming laptop that is reasonably priced    P.S. After additional 15 days I'd like add few things. First and foremost - be very careful with CD/DVD drive it tend to pop out all the time and yes it getting annoying. Yet another bad thing about backlit illuminated keyboard - it significantly reducing lifetime for battery in between recharges. A little rant about software packaged - no decent media player, I suggest get VLC. Windows 8.1 is fine (thanks God it's not Windows 8)just learn how to use it and bear in mind that this TN panel is not touch screen. Yet another small rant about manual - yes most people can distinguish mini HMDI from micro HMDI but why not said so in manual? 3 USB port feels somewhat short but USB port replicators and docking station can address that. As other reviewers mentioned - portioning SSD is not great idea, specially if your OS and preinstalled software take about 45GB - hence my recommendation use as much as possible external HDD or/and CaaS    P.P.S After about month and half using I have to reduce rating down to 3 stars and here is why. Drivers and updates. Do not ever let this machine use up battery down to less then 10% - you will get power state driver failure BCD .. and mind you I have not seen BCD on Windows machines for like 10 year. Well customer support was nice but to get machine from constant self reboot you have to do hard reset machine to factory settings (shut down, plug off power, remove batter, hold start button for 30 second). Next thing you have to do BIOS reset to default setting and getting to the BIOS is somewhat tricky (as soon as you hit restart - hit F2 otherwise you WILL miss BIOS. Once those 2 reset - DO NOT EVER download drivers from NVidia - do it only from ASUS to address Power state driver failure you will need 2 drivers VGA/SVGA NVidia driver from ASUS (get latest) and Chipset driver. Next problematic element - battery. If you planning on use any blue tooth speakers be warned - they eating charge blazing fast ... even if they actually not been in use just connected. So my advice as soon as you done with speakers - go to blue tooth device manager and disconnect them otherwise batter life on simple static page internet browsing will be 2 hour and less. Last but not least ... whenever you install windows updates there is a chance that it will reset your graphic setting from NVidia back to \\""auto\\"" which in turn will cause this laptop pick the heat fairly fast. I am totally in agreement now with 3 star review that indicates this is great laptop but not out of box and do require modest tweaking","7"

Checking for problems I did not see anything that was evident. 1 month later I heard a much louder noise and saw that in one corner the bezel was starting to separate from the lid. I think it is important to say that this happened with no abuse on the equipment on my side or as a consequence of an accident. My conclusion is that the laptop arrived having an assembly problem. Until this point I said to myself that I was unlucky and needed to contact Lenovo to have it repair being the equipment under warranty. At this point the real problem started: the answer from warranty was disappointed. Let me try to explain:  - the web site is really unclear, trying to find the way to contact Lenovo took quite a while  - My first call was performed Dec 24th, the person on the phone said that the system was slow and if she could call me back to continue the process. She never called back  - second call Dec 26th, the person on the phone explained pretty well the steps to send the equipment to TX (opening a #case, etc), I sent it the same day  - they return to me today Jan 2nd, saying that I should pay $269 if I wanted the laptop to be repaired, because the basic warranty does not cover my issue. I checked the terms of the warranty and they do not cover under warranty if there has been misused or accident. As explained before the origin of the problem is a bad assembly of the bezel not misuse or accident  - Jan 2nd I called twice trying to explain on the phone (I also have pictures and video showing that the laptop was in mint condition besides the bezel problem: NO ACCIDENT OR MISUSE), every time I waited 20 minutes and nobody answered my call  All in all, beware that Lenovo will not properly support the quality of their products if you purchased with the std warranty (they do it if you have the premium one only) + trying to contact Lenovo support is aVERY lengthy process and probably  a waste of your time. Shame on Lenovo treating customers this way.  I will try again to contact them and update the review if the picture above changes.    Update Feb 5th  As explained to one person requesting earlier update (see comments) I finally found a supervisor on the phone that understood the problem, and checking that this was not my fault, he voided the charge to repair the hinge of the lid. The initial date to finish the process was end of January (they did not have the part in stock) but fortunately the laptop was returned to me much earlier (around January 20th). Since then:  - The hinge seems to work well  - There is a plastic covering the hinge that with a very light pressure still makes noise (not a quality expected from a $1150 laptop)  - The wifi card is working well only close to the router (my wife has another Y50 and she has much, much better reception and not problem to connect around the house). I am not even thinking to send the laptop again to Lenovo, I bought a wifi range extender, that has so far solved the issue    As a summary: The problem with the hinge was solved but took over 20 days to receive the laptop back + be aware that took a fair amount of time on the phone to convince Lenovo support that the problem with the hinge was not my fault (standard warranty could be tricky) + certain plastic parts seem to be poor quality (cover for the hinge) + Having another smaller problems (wifi card). I am returning 2 stars to my review (from one star to three) just because in the end they understood the problem, but I am still desappointed about quality and support of the product.    In addition two tips: I am not convinced about the quality of the screen. Mine is only the 1080 version ==> go for the 4k if this affordable for you (I have read very good reviews about it) + The hybrid hard disk is slow ==> replace for a good SSD as soon as possible and you will see a big improvement in performance. My preferenceis Samsung 840 evo or 850 evo, they work really well, are affordable, and the disk allows encryption as security measure (they are encrypted by default and allows password from system BIOS).","6"

Beautiful design. Runs everything I throw at it effortlessly. The two games I've downloaded so far (DayZ and Dota2) not only run at ultra-high settings, but I can run multiple programs such as iTunes, Skype, Eclipse IDE, Chrome with multiple tabs including Youtube at the same time and it barely winces.<br /><br />When I was researching rigs I didn't think my new purchase would include a HDD, but laptop's boot times aren't really that bad. And the laptop can be easily upgraded to SSD.<br /><br />The battery life is what you need. A solid three hours of semi-intensive use.<br /><br />Windows 8.1? Meh. It's really not too different from Windows 7 (except they removed the 'disable wireless adapter when wired access is active' function, which I miss but isn't really an issue) once you get passed the initial app screen, or whatever Windows calls it.<br /><br />The fan? I didn't adjust my sleep timer settings when I first started using this laptop, so when I left my laptop for awhile, and came back to a black screen with no sound being emitted I thought it shut off. Click the mouse and the screen immediately flickers live and I'm back to what I was doing. Incredibly silent (especially during intensive use).<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I read all ~120 of the Amazon and Newegg reviews for this laptop before I purchased it. And I have to agree that the battery cord connection could be a little more secure, but I can't envision too many circumstances where it'd be an issue.<br /><br />As for the rest of the reviews that shed a negative light on this laptop. Non-issues as far as I'm concerned, at least not to the inherent quality of this laptop.<br /><br />  (1) Do you suffer from fat finger syndrome and short term memory issues? Well then, yes, you might accidentally hit the record button nestled next to the escape button.<br /><br />  (2) Steam button does open into full-screen mode, but it is a useful interface and I can see how it'd be appropriate for those who wanted to navigate Steam and their profile.<br /><br />  (3) I understand how frustrating defective products can be but as Marsellus Wallace from Pulp Fuction says \\""it's a hard mother-f***in' fact of life\\"". All of my keys are seated fine and represent an all-together quality keyboard. The screen has no yellow'ish hue. Nobody molested my laptop with fingerprints prior to shipping. And ASUS even included a screen/shell wipe for any cheeto dust/grease I might leave on the laptop.<br /><br />  (4) Sound quality? Not bad. There are no speakers on the face of the laptop, so the L/R sound kinda depends on how you orientate yourself to the position of the laptop. Honestly, I don't have much reference for quality laptop sound, but there's nothing for me to complain about, especially if you're watching a movie.<br /><br />I can't speak for ASUS customer service, as I've never had to interact or rely on them. However, I hope everyone who purchases this laptop has the same great experience as me and I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.n see how it'd be appropriate for those who wanted to navigate Steam and their profile.

"B00OBQ5950","ASUS G751JT 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","4","2015-01-15","Solid choice.","I'm using it for both playing games and working.    The pros:  The specs are solid and do deliver performance - recent games are on \\""ultra\\"" settings and running flawlessly. Working with large data sets is also a breeze. There are some other ASUS utilities like easy game recording, steam button, asus web storage, etc, that are nice to have. Network is excellent and so is the sound - this machine really can play things loud.    The cons:  Bigger than expected. It is big and heavy to the point of having reduced mobility for a laptop - this is not something to take with you to your favorite coffee shop or on a bus/train/airplane/etc. Not a big deal to me though since I'll be just moving it around the house. It seems a bit fragile when it comes to temperature: the official manual tells to not use it in environments above 35C (95F). Since I live in South America this is the case in many days of the year, so this is something to be cautious. However, I do frequent temperature checks and internal temps are usually at half of their max values, so it is not something to worry too much. Just don't leave it in the sun.    Overall:  There are other (more expensive) options with even more raw power and mobility, but given the price, I found this model a solid choice when it comes to price/performance. If you don't care about the cons I've mentioned and your budget won't allow more expensive laptops, I recommend this one.","4"

(Feels like a 20pound dumbbell)<br />-Power cord plug (It snaps in/out with no problem but it doesn't feel very secure inside and can be unplugged with almost no force. It came loose few times just moving laptop around)<br />-Speakers ( Probably the worst thing about this laptop, they just sound awful. Strongly recommend decent headphones)<br /><br />BEWARE OF AMAZON PACKAGING !<br />I had to get 2 replacements because first two came with dead pixels. Amazon support was great !!!, within 1hr of replacement request I got e-mail that they created RMA and overnighted me a new one both times !!!<br /><br />The ONLY reason this is not 5stars is because of the packaging. The Box that the laptop was in was so badly beat up, had holes in few places and inside had NO protection whatsoever, unless you count 1 sheet of paper as protection. The laptop box was just freely sliding around inside. I notified support about it and got a response how sorry they are, and they will forward the issue to their shipping team.

The SSD lets it boot up fast.<br /><br />Any downsides are minor annoyances. Moving the laptop while running seems to invariably cause the DVD drive to open. The power connector is a tad loose and can fall out more easily than it should.

For some reason the manufactures partition the 256 GB solid-state drive (SSD) to 125 GB and 90 GB where 90 GB is where all the program files, pictures, music, etc. go automatically. You'll find you'll run out of space quickly, and unless you're a Windows guru, you'll have a hard time moving program files to another drive. I tried that and it didn't work. Videos, pictures, music fine but program files, no way! I had to re-install everything after re-formatting and re-partitioning the c: drive. (SSD) Even then 256 GB is not all that much in today's world, so if you have the money find one with 512 GB. Other than that the computer boots up really fast and works really fast. It doesn't come with Windows 8.1 PRO, so if you want the PRO edition you'll have to spend an extra $100 somewhere like Best Buy or Microsoft. For the money, I think it's well worth it.","3"

It does not disappoint in the power department.<br />However, it leans too far toward the gamers.<br />The keyboard is flat black with red lettering that is impossible to read unless you have a very bright light on the keyboard, which in turn washes out the screen. You can turn the red backlight on underneath the keys, but then the glare from the light under the keys still make it hard to see the keys unless you look directly down on them. And those lights also eat battery power. The keyboard feels good and is well laid out, but if you want a keyboard you can see and use easily, this isn't the one.<br />The logo on the laptop cover lights up. I don't mind the logo...I do mind that it eats up battery power. The powerful processor and graphics card already eat enough battery power. I can't figure out how to turn the logo off.<br />However, the box runs everything I've thrown at it and does that part of it well. I wish ASUS had done a better job on the ergonometrics of the keyboard, but I guess that's why it was cheaper than some of the other alternatives.","0"

Asus has been kind and helpful with trying to fix it but seeing as this has been a problem nearly since I opened it I think I got a bad computer. I did not download any weird programs, just your usual games such as LoL and WoW. It used to just blue screen, and I have probably done system repair 10 times. I have also updated drives, uninstalled drives, etc all suggested by ASUS. Now, as of today, it will not turn on. I am being told the driver is corrupt, and that it must do a system repair, when it repairs it says the systems is corrupts and cannot repair, and then freezes on blue screen. Go figure. :/ I really hope I am able to get a refund or a replacement because I REALLY need a laptop and I spent so much money on this, being out over 1,000 dollars, as a college student, is horrible.","1"

"B00IKF2H12","ASUS ROG G750JM 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [OLD VERSION]","4","2015-02-12","Wish I could have used it. Don't buy from Amazon Warehouse","First, giving this 4 stars since it's the average rating at time of review and I don't think it's fair to put 1 star for the product I couldn't use too much. This is more of a review for how terrible Amazon Warehouse guidelines are for Very Good condition (and probably most other conditions).<br /><br />I bought this laptop on Friday with 1 day shipping. I picked the best used one they had for $870 (now they're 1000+) based on the description. I didn't receive the laptop until Wednesday since the geniuses at the warehouse this was located gave me UPS ground shipping. I was compensated by Amazon for their mistake since they have a great customer service team. I shipped the computer back today, Thursday. Not even one full day of having the laptop and I had to return it due to wrong description. I do admit I had a sour taste in my mouth from the Monday guaranteed delivery to Wednesday delivery so this computer had to rock from the get go.<br /><br />The accessories that were bundled were in great condition as mentioned and there was a small speck on the top of the computer, but the bottom of the computer had scratches all over it. This was not mentioned in the description.  I didn't mind since I don't really look at the bottom of a laptop and I was excited to get the computer on and see what it could handle. Initial bootup time was slow and I had to update a bunch of things, but that's expected. I bought an SSD  for a boot drive, but I did not install it. I immediately downloaded Steam and a couple of games. Download was extremely fast. On Wifi, 2 rooms away from the router, it did the same exact speed as my hardwired desktop. I was impressed.<br /><br />However, I noticed in the bottom right of the task bar an X. I hovered over it and it said battery not installed, so it's basically running on the plug power. I powered down, turned the computer over and verified the battery was in, which it was, and powered it back on. Same thing. A dead battery is a big deal to me. Iwould have rather spent the money building a comparable desktop if I needed to leave it plugged in all the time. Amazon could not give me a new battery. I would have to return the whole computer or keep the dead battery and pay out of pocket for a new one. Since I knew I was going to return the computer, I didn't bother installing the SSD (which I also returned. Don't need one for my desktop) and I decided to play the games I downloaded before I packed it up to return.<br /><br />It didn't occur to me that I didn't try to listen music or watch a video, or do anything involving audio until I booted up the first game I downloaded (TF2). The speakers were going out. It was out going from left channel to right channel (and not stereo. These were literally going out as I was playing). The tiny subwoofer was about the only thing that was constant and it was muffled sounding like I was playing the game underwater. I don't know if that's how it's supposed to sound combined with the regular speakers since I didn't get a chance to see how they all interacted with each other. I wasn't mad since I already knew I was returning the computer, but if I was keeping it I wouldn't be happy. I tried a more demanding game (Bioshock Infinite) and boosted up the graphics to normal (on low preset for some reason). Game played fine. Didn't notice any major framerate dips but couldn't play for more than 5 minutes before I turned it off since the speaker issue was so bad. I then packed it up and shipped it out this morning.<br /><br />This was the 2nd defective return I had to return because of Amazon Warehouse. I'm sure they get a ton of items returned on a daily basis and they can't test everything, and people lie when they return things so they don't have to pay a fee. The first was a PS4 that had a bad disk drive. It kept clicking when I tried to play a game. I would hope they have some kind of QA when it came to putting stuff out for resale. I have a bad feeling they're just going to put the computer I bought back on the website without really checking it out. I made it clear what the issues were so it's up to them to fix it or not. I don't really mind returning to Amazon. There's a drop off location 2 minutes away from me. I would hope they cared about paying back and forth shipping on these faulty items. I just hate having my money tied up for a week waiting for the refund.<br /><br />The laptop seems like it would be a 4-5 star laptop for the price I paid. My budget was about 800 so I stretched it a bit. I really wanted to stay under 1000. I see a Y50 on ebay through Newegg brand new for 850 with same specs but 15 inch screen. I think I need to not buy high end electronics from Amazon Warehouse unless I have money I can part with for a while, while the return process happened.<br /><br />As for Amazon Warehouse. The employees need remedial training. I ordered many items with one day shipping from Amazon and always received them the next day until I purchased this laptop. The guidelines need to be more strict. Don't call something Very Good condition when the speakers don't work and the battery is dead. I hear cowboom has great guidelines and usually underrate their items so you get it better than expected. Never ordered from them and probably won't since I don't like best buy, but maybe Amazon can take a page out of their book, especially on these high end items.","1"

And last, but not least (since this is first and foremost a gaming laptop), this laptop has been running DIABLO 3 (with perfection) since I first got it.  I'll be installing TitanFall next.  If you want a powerful workstation AND a gaming laptop for under $1500, this configuration (32 GB and Blue Ray R/W) of the MSI GT70 Dominator-895 17.3\\"" i7-4800MQ will be really hard to beat","2"

So far, so good!  Everything fits in this case with room to spare for other things (chargers, etc).  There is an outside zipper pocket, which is also roomy and handy to have.  Very good padding on the inside- (some kind of foam with spheres (for impact resistance)? and a smooth surface that I don't think will tear easily).  The material on the outside has a smooth (polyester/nylon)? feel to it.  My son's only complaint is that it doesn't have some kind of handle or strap you can grab, if necessary, because he carries it on top of his books at school.  I think this is very high quality for what I paid for it; it got here quickly.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it has a strong smell, that we are still trying to &#34;air out&#34; of it, for the last week or so.  The smell IS getting better, but is significant. I'm also concerned that the plastic zipper may not hold out over long term use but that is just a &#34;wait and see&#34; kind of thing.","3"

The keyboard feels nice and natural and I like the backlit lights. The screen is nice and the GPU plays high end games with no issues. I paid 1299.00 no taxes or shipping so I am pretty happy so far.

I'm not sure if MSI has updated the whole 211 product run or if it's hit or miss on which one you'll get but the screen is fantastic and the professor runs 100mhz faster at both base and turbo than what is advertised in the description.<br />That said this is simply the best laptop I have ever owned. This is my 4th gaming laptop, I owned an HP, a Sager, MSI GS70 and now this one. The thing is amazingly quiet and cool while running games like Far Cry 4 at ultra (45-60 fps). Also for productivity I'm getting about 6 hrs of battery life when the GPU is turned off. Finally the MXM GPU is a great bonus since it future proofs the laptop with the ability to upgrade the GPU, MSI even has a how to video on YouTube. Oh and this might sound silly to comment on in the review but my Sager had a really short cord from the power brick making it hard to sit the brick on the floor and use the laptop on a couch or desk so I'm happy to report that the power cord on this thing is a generous 6'.","4"
"B00OBA5AMI","ASUS ROG 15.6"" Gaming Laptop w/ GeForce GTX860M 2GB GDDR5 and Optimus Technology","5","2015-03-20","Perfect for Video Editing on the Go!","The only thing you need to know other than the specs is that the graphics card does not work &#34;at full power&#34; when on battery. So if you want maximum performance, plug in the laptop. A few notes on the screen are below as well.<br /><br />I use this to edit video in premiere pro. I use heavy effects such as warp and film convert and as long as it's plugged in - it works perfectly after I did the quick little hack to enable the 860m.<br /><br />In fact, with a 1tb ssd installed in place of the optical drive using a little HD caddy, this is just as capable (when plugged in) as my old 8-core AMD FX-8350/16gb ram/ssds/gtx 760/etc.<br /><br />For gaming, I can only imagine this is an incredible compromise between a full-on gaming system and portability. I can't imagine it having any trouble at all with even the most demanding games.<br /><br />Heat. Well, it does get hot. Welcome to graphics cards. However, it's only going to get hot when it's being heavily used and you can obviously do a few things to help the poor laptop out in the heat department.<br /><br />The screen is nice. It's very matte. Make sure you update to the absolute latest nvidia drivers as well or you might feel the screen looks like garbage. When I first started using the laptop, all my fonts and graphics looked stretched and nasty. Updating everything including windows 8.1 fixed this problem.<br /><br />Color accuracy is probably not brilliant, but it's not bad. I haven't actually checked it out but I don't do a lot of color grading so I'm not too concerned.<br /><br />It WILL run dual monitors if you wish to use HDMI -and- Displayport. So if you like, you can easily use a bluetooth keyboard and external mouse to convert this back into a desktop-like machine.<br /><br />Anyhow, great laptop and even pretty good battery life considering it's size and power.<br /><br />Power draw is also VERY impressive when compared to a desktop. Idle power is basically nothing, full tilt it gets up to around 150 Watts...which in desktop terms is laughably good.50 Watts...which in desktop terms is laughably good.","2"

The Display is crisp, it boots really fast even without an ssd and its gaming power in unbelievable. What i've learned so far about my new computer is that its really not a casual computer. It handles Ultra graphics on bio-shock infinite without any problems, and almost every game i've tested on this beast runs smoothly and comfortably on Ultra. THIS MACHINE PREFERS ULTRA GRAPHICS. Running such a powerful computer on anything less then some of the highest settings wastes its power. I've noticed that when this machine performs tasks like browsing the web it's really not the best. It tends to heat up the GPU a bit and as a result i've found that its much easier to perform these tasks on a weaker laptop or even a tablet. The battery life is not the best, its basically so this thing doesn't turn off when your moving it from one room to another but that's expected because you're really never going to play any games without this machine plugged in. The screen does feel a bit flimsy but I CAN OPEN THE COMPUTER EASILY with one hand. The track pad is also textured so it doesn't feel as sensitive as it should be but i use a wireless mouse so it never really bothers me. I think this machine is a nice gaming laptop and with the Nvidia 965 you can find a nice balance between price, performance, and heat. I would really recommend this computer to anyone who wants a high quality gaming laptop without wanting to pay $2,000- $3,000. (BTW i've had this machine for a weekend so far)","3"

I have had my beast for the better part of a month now and i just have to say, bravo again ASUS! i upgraded from a ASUS G60Vx which i have loved for 6 years but lately just couldn't handle today's new and heavily updated games. The machine fires right up and breezes through multiple windows/programs/browsers all open at once with no hickups. As far as the &#34;fabric feel&#34; that i read reviews about getting dirty easily and staining with cleaner, for the record its only on the back side of the screen, the palm rest faceplate is all plastic(which was one of my worries prior to getting but now am very relieved). The laptop defiantly looks great, and coming from my G60Vx which most of the time had the fan running so loud i actually had to adjust the volume to hear my media, i haven't even heard the fans in this new ASUS once! I defiantly see myself keeping this new rig for years to come!<br /><br />p.s...For diehard World of Warcraft fans that want to boost everything to Ultra across the board and run 10 addons at a time, yes this ASUS is going to be perfect for you! I've been raiding with 30 people and its been smooth and beautiful the whole time.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: the reason i couldn't give this amazing laptop a 5 star review is because the speakers sound a little muffled...i mean the sound is brilliantly loud and all(twice as loud as my old laptop at full), it just is not a super clear/clean sound when u really listen to it....solution, i have a sound system hooked up to my rig.","0"

"B00OBA5AMI","ASUS ROG 15.6"" Gaming Laptop w/ GeForce GTX860M 2GB GDDR5 and Optimus Technology","5","2015-01-08","I love it!","I want to say I feel this laptop is absolutely amazing, especially for the price comparing it to other laptops that it competes with, but I have to state that my use for this laptop is not gaming. I needed a laptop with a quad processor, 16gigs of ram, 15&#34; screen and above, and hopefully an SSD. I paid just over $1300 with immediate shipping and the other laptop I was considering with this price range was the HP Envy 17 Touchsmart j141nr that is for $999 at Microsoft Store. The Asus ROG GL551JM was for $1,199. When I realized the HP had a 5400 rpm hard drive I closed the website and ordered the Asus. Again, this comparison was mainly because I am not using my machine for gaming, otherwise I probably would have not considered the HP Envy. I want to stress a couple points but before that I could not take off a star for any of these I will mention. The machine performs fantastic. I use Risa 3d on it, Revit, and AutoCAD 3d perfectly without any lag at all. Now to the important items.<br /><br />1. Yes, the screen is not anything to go crazy over. It isn't awesome, but I can appreciate it perfectly fine. Comparing it to other 1080p monitors I have it does fall behind, but I expected this and it doesn't affect my work. Mainly its the angles you have to be changing for certain views and not all the time.<br /><br />2. Take the fingerprint thing seriously if you care about this. I knew and had seen and read about the fingerprints on this machine, but expected them to come off easily. They don't. It takes quite a bit of rubbing with a static free rag, and using screen wipes make little difference. Again, not enough for me to drop a star. For some, like some of my friends, its  a deal breaker.<br /><br />3. The charger is big. I really feel its larger than it could be. Don't know, but it adds some weight and takes up space on the chair or table for sure. I've had other Dell laptops (17&#34; screens) that had much smaller charging blocks. However, it may be that it needs it.<br /><br />4. Would have preferred another USB slot to an HDMI. Being that it has a mini display port I don't see the need for both. However, this being a gaming machine, I can predict it is for adding two more monitors. Still another USB slot would have been nice.<br /><br />Strong Points: The backlit keyboard is sweet. I love the keyboard, especially the fact that it has a number keypad. The touchpad for me is really nice. I have no complaints like others have posted. It works awesome. For the price, it having 16gigs of ram, 256 SSD, quad i7 processor (recent version), and the Nvidia 860 card, I really think there is no comparison out there. The laptop feels very professional and at the office everyone was impressed. One last thing, I don't feel it is too heavy. I have had many laptops before, and this Asus just feels fine to carry around.<br /><br />I hope my comments have helped. For anyone looking for a CAD and BIM machine. I really recommend this laptop!","14"

It has overheated a few times to the point it will almost burn you lol but this was fixed with a simple cooler fan placed under it. I did have to reapply some thermal paste and heat up the solder on the mother board once due to the overheating melting it but it's still a champ and does what I need it to. I'm assuming the newer versions are a lot better. I built myself a desktop so it's only used for traveling or when I'm on duty","0"

I'm a computer programmer, and my only complaint is that the fan ratchets up to a very loud setting when my machine is doing a 20 second CPU intensive build. I haven't done much gaming but the unit doesn't get as hot as I expected after all of the press regarding heat dissipation of these slim gaming laptops. Battery life is about what I expected based on reviews.<br /><br />It's taken some time to get my OS set up properly. The machine was not resuming from sleep properly sometimes, and I was able to download a new driver for the Intel graphics on my own. I don't know why this wasn't suggested to me by Windows Update or the Razer updater. I've also had to find alternatives to some of my go-to programs because they look terrible on a high dpi screen. Windows itself has also been a little buggy - sometimes the start button just doesn't work. I hope that more and more programs scale appropriately as time goes on.","1"

Coming from a 6 year old HP piece of crap, this is pretty much heaven. I purchased the DS74 model with IPS display and an additional 128gb SSD and it flies. Been playing Resident Evil 5 on Steam on all the highest setting with over 80fps. After the new turn that consoles are taking I didn't want to buy a PS4 or XBOX One. This is perfect for my needs. I get a great performing laptop with the power to handle most games well. The design is also top notch with an excellent keyboard, a surprisingly nice touchpad, and great overall design. I also like that it's not a gimmicky touch screen. I know that it's all the rage now, but if I really wanted to reach up and get fingerprints all over my screen..... oh wait, I don't. I've owned this laptop for a little over two weeks now and it has been great for my needs. Mostly web surfing, multimedia, streaming video, word processing, and casual gaming. For the price it fits those needs perfectly and delivers a great overall package. I don't usually write reviews, but this laptop deserved some recognition. Update: After owning this laptop for not quite 2 years now, I would have to say the ASUS has some glaring problems that they need to fix. The Blue screen was a constant problem. Ultimately the SSD failed. I am currently getting this replaced, but I realize now that a lot of the problems I had stemmed from this. In addition, internet connectivity has been a problem as well. The Wireless adapter would need to be reset, sometimes 10-15 times in an online movie session. Realistically, for the price, maybe I should have expected this as it seemed to be a good deal. However if I had to do it again, I would probably look elsewhere. Asus also needs to work on their customer support, as it is probably the worse, right next to HP.","5"

I've been playing DoI on the highest settings very smoothly.  I've been running Photoshop, After Effects, Premier, and Illustrator (often simultaneously) without issue.  This laptop has the power to do almost anything.  I am very happy with the purchase, but I will list the only negatives I've found so far for the sake of completeness.  It is large (both a pro and a con), so the backpacks made for ASUS ROG 17&#34; + laptops will work best.  I bought backpacks made by OGIO and timbuk2 for 17&#34; laptops, but the laptop fit in neither of them.  It's powerful (a pro for sure), so that means even the brand new battery has a very short life when I'm doing anything.  I've been able to watch a movie on a full charge with headphones on, but any gaming or serious editing/creating will require a power cord.  On a most minor note, the 10-key pad has a 0 key directly beneath the 2 and the same size as all the other keys.  If you're quite accustomed to the 0 key being offset and/or larger, it will be very annoying.  Those issues are the only gripes I can come up with really, so that should say something about how happy I am so far.","1"

I reduced the rating only because I think the mouse pad area on the laptop could use improvement. After having owned other ASUS models it seems ASUS has a difficult time coming up with integrated mouse pads, this is better than my last ASUS but they still need to work on a better mouse. The graphics are excellent with the exception of some texts which can be a bit blurry.  I almost tend to watch Netflix as much on this PC as much as I play games because of the super resolution. The speakers are not as powerful as I would like, so be sure to adjust them on the laptop settings and also choose the dolby option if watching movies when the movies allow it, otherwise they are fairly adequate for gaming. The fingerprint issue is considerable but not something I worry too much about. Make certain you check all the settings. Some of the defaults are not on the best setting just be aware you may need to adjust them which is easily done. This machine rarely gets hot and then not really hot just warm. It is the coolest running temperature laptop I have owned. Having owned ASUS in the past I can attest that their tech support was one of the reasons I choose to buy from them again, they are heads above the crowd and when you are investing a bit more in a laptop you want to know if anything goes wrong you can count on them to back up their product.","1"
"B00M1C1YUU","Lenovo Y50 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (59418223) Black","2","2015-01-15","Infuriating flaws that ruin a seemingly beautiful laptop","UPDATE - I'm  updating this old review on the off-chance that it provides an answer to a desperately confused Y50 user. I bought this laptop for my wife, who has complained about &#34;insanely slow load times&#34; for web browsing since we got the machine in 2015. However, whenever I tested it out to investigate the issue, I found that pages were loading instantly and figured she was crazy. This went on for 15 months before she forced me to watch over her shoulder. Sure enough, pages were taking minutes to load, if at all. I researched the network adapter (Intel AC-7260) and discovered it is notoriously awful and should have been recalled ages ago. So I bought a TP-Link USB wifi dongle, and patted myself on the back for solving the problem. When I tested it out, everything was zippy as could be. But when given back to my wife, it gave her the same slooooowww page loading. I wanted to cry. I may have. Doesn't matter. And then I remembered a very stupid post I read in a Y50 user forum about how the slow web speeds were related to the position of the laptop. He claimed that the problem only occurs when the laptop is not flat on a horizontal surface. Oh brother, I thought. But now... I'm realizing that my wife only ever reclines with her laptop. She never places it on a table or desk, and I always do. Turns out, that &#34;stupid&#34; post was completely right. Web speeds are great when horizontal, and disappear into oblivion when anything but horizontal. Honestly. If I knew any Lenovo employees, I'd go egg their house.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />It's not easy finding a PC laptop with the power I want in a size/weight that I'm comfortable with. This thing is powerful. I'm very impressed with the speed. And it is thinner and lighter than my Asus with similar specs. The 4K screen is beautiful, though from the many reviews I've read, it seems there are plenty of flawed screens being shipped.<br /><br />Let's get right to the cons:<br />-First, this machine does not come with the i7-4750HQ like the description says. It comes with an i7-4710HQ. There is a sizable difference in the performance specs for the two processors if you're check benchmarks. That's def Amazon's screw-up.<br />-The ticking noise that others have mentioned is a real annoyance. It's like a metronome ticking away inside the laptop. I have no idea what that could be, since the machine does not have a HDD.<br />-The wireless card that comes with the machine is garbage. A quick Google search revealed that millions of people are ticked about this little nightmare from Intel. I'll be calling Lenovo to try to wrangle a replacement from a different manufacturer. Just FYI - the card regularly disconnects from our home wifi. A few clicks and it's reconnected, but that's insanely annoying.<br /><br />It's a phenomenal laptop in general, so I'm giving it 4 stars despite the issues. I won't fault the laptop for Amazon's mistaken description, but the ticking noise and the wireless card might be deal-breakers for me.he description says. It comes with an i7-4710HQ.

Satisfied overall. [New details]","PROS<br />1080P RESOLUTION: A different experience for movies and browsing if you have not gotten up to this standard. You can change the resolution to 900P if the text and programs seem small.<br />BRIGHT: I was expecting an upset, but it is bright enough to give me a head ache. The red back light definitely helps with the questionable design of dark letters on a dark background.<br />GTX 860M: I can run almost any game on high to ultra graphics. This is on par with high end, class one, graphics. You can probably play ultra at the cost of downsizing to a lower resolution and windowed.<br />SOUND: I do not know what people complain about in regard to the bass. I did some careful tinkering, and I do not know how, but there was an internal subwoofer, apparently installed on my laptop. Even so, you can always mess with sound options by ticking loudness equalization, environment, equalizer (bass), virtual surround, etc. advanced tab, audiowizard program, etc.<br />*SSD: I opted for the SSD instead of the HDD, because I can manage with 256GB, and need only a handful of programs to keep my laptop safe and useful. SSD is noticeably faster (5x), unbelievably quiet, but still expensive. If you do not have an external drive, you probably might want the HDD.<br /><br />CONS<br />*WINDOWS 8.1: You will have to deal with this. Find a way to emulate the Windows 7 feel. Download the Pokki App as a Start Menu. Play around with the main screen if you have the time. Resize the apps, for example. Delete the bloatware: ASUS Music, Video, Reading List, etc. It shaves off and gives a few space. Very important for SSD users. Get the VLC media player instead.<br />FINGER MAGNET: I am a clean person, but I did not expect to leave so much oily prints. It is kind of off-putting and very difficult to remove, I imagine.<br />16GB: I feel like I do not need this amount ever. I can deal with 6 to 8gbs, where they could have put more thought into other resources or features in place of more RAM.<br />TN: This is not IPS as I am told. I can see what other people are talking about when they mention this. The text for all programs look bloated and blurred a bit, while an IPS version is readable at a glance. IPS should have been the choice. The issue is negligible for the most part.<br />ARROWS: They are incredibly cramped for a 15.6\\"" laptop. For other keys, I am still trying to get used to.<br />*TRACKPAD: Every laptop has a weak one. Just substitute for a mouse.<br />**LAN PORT: Yes, the LAN works, but the port lid was difficult to go through.<br /><br />I really want to know how to add in another SSD just in case, if not replace the optical drive for an HDD. The last time I opened a laptop, the audio and USB ports stopped working. So, I am bit weary now and would rather not take out or put in hardware. The pros definitely outweigh the cons, but for an expensive laptop, most of the cons should have been foreseen and taken care of ahead of time. There are a lot of details I have left out, cos I need sleep.<br /><br />*SSD is partitioned in two. I am not sure if that is such a good idea. Pagefile.sys and other hidden files can be seen with WinDirStat. It concerns me if the settings I have now will eat up a chunk of the space.<br />*WINDOWS 8.1 is looking more appealing, but lacks a lot of tools or settings to configure and change its appearance. I can live with it without resorting to downgrading or installing Windows 7.<br />*TRACKPAD is excellent. I retract the comment that it is weak.<br />**LAN PORT: No longer works for my laptop as of Dec 2015. Very regretful purchase with one star less.

This thing absolutely destroys anything you throw at it- in a good way. It makes editing massive projects a breeze- something I can't say about the Macs I've been working on the last few years. It plows through HD footage like it isn't there, and from what I've seen so far, I'd bet it would do just fine with 4K footage. Renders are a breeze, and even when processing complex effects, long renders, and GPU-accelerated effects, this laptop stays cool and quiet.<br />While there are a few superficial, minor things (the num lock turns itself off when you shut down or reboot the computer it comes with a BluRay reader instead of burner) this is perfect for media professionals and gamers. Of course, while it does have a very wide set of viewing angles for a gaming laptop, you will get a bit of a color shift depending on how far you tip your screen. (Granted, if you're serious about getting colors right, you're using an external reference monitor that costs at least as much as this entire rig.)<br />This thing is huge; for a huge guy like me, that's great. It weighs close to 10lbs, and unless you have a gargantuan computer bag, this won't fit in what you have. That said, this is a desktop replacement, so if you're looking to move around a ton, you're looking in the wrong place (unless you're huge, like me, then this is easy to carry around).<br />And, since this is a gaming computer, I'll throw something about its gaming performance in this already long-ish review. I don't game much, especially on my editing rig, but just for kicks and giggles I threw Star Wars: The Old Republic and a few other games on and tested them out; Ultra settings? No big deal. This rig didn't even break a sweat. Stayed quiet and cool to the touch the entire time. (Just don't make the mistake of putting something in front one of the fans... that'll melt your chocolate faster than you'd think.)<br />I spent many, many months researching all the different options out there before buying the G750JZ-DS71. I kept coming back to it. It was the right call. Whether or not it's the right rig for you is up to you, but I'd highly recommend it.","1"

After fully testing it for over a week I will update this amazon review!","0"

"B00KYI7WTA","Lenovo Y50 Performance Gaming Laptop - DOORBUSTER","5","2015-01-28","Pricey, but well worth it if you can stand having to buy an expensive monitor to pair.","I will give this laptop full marks, even if my beautiful Samsung 27 inch monitor is not working quite right with the resolution paired to this laptop. Coming out of the box, the laptop is gorgeous. It looks like a race car, ready to go 150 mph and loving it. The black top surface is smooth, the surface around the keyboard has texture to it, non-skid, not metallic like some less expensive laptops, and the red-lit keyboard is helpful in the dark and quite striking. The laptop is advertised to be a &#34;gamer's dream&#34; and I have to admit, that is not the reason I bought it. I don't game, I am a professional photographer and teacher. This laptop has 4K resolution which I love for my photography. Never had anything this nice. But when connected to even a very good monitor, if it isn't 4K, there is a problem. The resolution on the external monitor can't be adjusted to work perfectly. I will have to buy a 4K monitor in the future, but for now I use the HDMI connections and I live with it. The weight is truly light for such a powerful system. The touch screen version is a little heavier. I didn't need the touch screen so I went with this model. The battery life is not great because of the RAM and the power, depending on the power settings, but I did get 4.5 hours out of it at school. If you don't need 4K quality and you don't need 16GB of RAM, this may not be the right fit for you as it is hundreds more than a system with 8GB RAM. But if you want a computer to last a few years without regrets, this is the one. No regrets.","2"

"B00OBQ5950","ASUS G751JT 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","1","2015-01-31","Buyer beware. UPDATED REVIEW","NOTE: I am including my original review below. I loved this computer at first, but at less than two years old, it has completely failed. The keyboard stopped working properly due to a hardware issue about two months after the warranty expired, and ASUS wants $700 to repair it. Don't bother. The build quality on these things is intolerable. I'm going with another brand, and I will never buy an ASUS product again.<br /><br />I'm a musician who also loves video games. Since both of those hobbies/pursuits require a beefy computer, I decided to go with a laptop designed for gaming. After some research, I decided that this machine was the best value for the money. I'm very pleased to say that I have not been disappointed, and it fixes a lot of problems I've had with my previous Asus ROG laptops.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />This laptop might not be the most powerful one on the market (or even the most powerful one by ASUS), but it packs a hefty punch. I just about maxed out the settings on Dragon Age Inquisition, and at 1920x1080 resolution, it runs at a silky smooth framerate. The CPU isn't the fastest out there, but the turbo boost does make up for quite a bit. The 16 GB of RAM is great for both gaming and for the high-end audio work I do, and being able to upgrade it to 32 GB is a huge plus. The 970M has 3 GB of RAM for graphics, and while it's not the highest end mobile card, it's a lot more reasonably priced than the 980M and a lot more powerful than the 960M.<br /><br />My old ROG laptop had a crummy 5400 rpm hard drive, which really made starting and shutting down the computer a huge pain. I'm pleased to report that this computer, with its solid state drive (partitioned into two drives, one designated for the operating system and system files) is ready to go within well under a minute of me hitting the power button. The solid state drive is small-ish, so I decided to install all of my games and store my documents on the standard hard drive (also split into two partitions). At 7200 rpm, it's fast enough not to impede performance for games.<br /><br />INPUT DEVICES:<br /><br />Another complaint I had about the previous ROG laptop I had was the finicky touchpad. Of course, touchpads aren't used for gaming, but it's simply not practical to take a mouse everywhere if you're going to be using the computer to take notes or use it on the go for anything besides gaming. This computer's touchpad is much better; it has a great response, and the buttons move much more freely than the old system's. The keyboard feels nice, too. The backlighting is more subtle than the previous editions, but you can still see the keys in the dark. They just don't flood the room with light anymore.<br /><br />It's also really neat having one-button access to Steam and the ROG software. It's really convenient. And the three macro buttons are close enough to WASD to be easily accessible.<br /><br />The function keys are also practical. In addition to the standard volume/brightness controls, you can also put the computer to sleep instantly, and switch WiFi on and off (basically, put the computer in Airplane Mode). There's also a button to instantly turn on ShadowPlay through GeForce Experience.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE:<br /><br />Of course, you won't get a whole lot of battery life out of this machine when it's running full blast. Honestly, I don't do a lot of gaming on the go. The previous ROG laptop I had used different power profiles to conserve battery life; that feature seems to be missing on this laptop (it just has the standard Windows profiles), but the battery does last for several hours when not gaming. I can use it to take notes in class or write music on the go and not have to worry about the battery dying suddenly.<br /><br />OTHER FEATURES:<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Asus's Quick Charge capabilities. Basically, when you have over a certain amount of battery left or are running off the wall power, one of your four USB 3.0 ports can be usedto very quickly charge your USB devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.). It'll even run when the computer is in hibernation if you want it to. In fact, the computer charges my phone faster than plugging it in directly to the outlet.<br /><br />One excellent feature that this laptop has is some of the bundled software. I'm not a fan of bloatware, but the software that's pre-installed on this laptop is actually really useful and not intrusive. There's software to set up the macro keys, adjust the picture and audio controls (there are different color profiles and sound profiles), and best of all, software to ration out your bandwidth to programs that need it the most. If you're gaming online, you can have your game take up most of the bandwidth so that you have a better connection. If you're downloading a file, you can set the download to the highest priority instead.<br /><br />SOUND:<br /><br />Of course, the speakers on any laptop are not going to be the most powerful. But if you're just in your apartment and don't need everything to shake, the audio quality is good. I do a lot of music production work, and while the speakers don't give me a perfect mix, they're good enough for me to sketch things out and then use either external speakers or other dedicated audio hardware to finalize. The subwoofer is good, and when using headphones, you get quite a lot of sound. Overall, I'm impressed with the speakers; they're among the best I've heard on a laptop, especially one not specifically designed for audiophiles (there's a world of difference between audiophile sound quality and gaming sound quality, so this is a definite plus). In a loud environment, though, it simply won't project, so it would be wise to invest in some good headphones/a gaming headset or speakers.<br /><br />PHYSICAL QUALITY:<br /><br />I'm a large, semi-muscular man, so I don't mind a big, heavy laptop (I have a big, manly lap). That being said, this computer is BIG. If you're looking for something truly portable, then you might want to stick with the more expensive, slim options out there. But it definitely feels sturdy. The hinges on the display are strong, and everything about the laptop feels well-built. The optical drive is the only thing that feels slightly flimsy, but it didn't feel like it was going to snap off when I put a disc in it. The laptop also has more rounded edges than previous ROG laptops, so it fits more easily into tight spaces despite being slightly bigger than previous editions.<br /><br />Also, these computers have excellent cooling. They don't get hot enough to scorch your lap thanks to the superior venting (heat is pushed out of the back rather than the bottom). It doesn't run any hotter than a non-gaming laptop; in fact, thanks to the venting, it actually runs cooler than a lot of laptops I've had before. There are also little risers beneath it that keep heat from staying trapped beneath the laptop's body, which is a neat addition.<br /><br />DISPLAY:<br /><br />I have no complaints about the display. It's a matte finish, so it doesn't glare. Different color settings, available through the included software, adjust the color balance to your tastes. The screen is very clear, and I have no complaints about it. Just know that it's not going to be a shiny display like some of those higher end laptops might have.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />I was hesitant to shell out $1,700+ for a laptop, but I'm very pleased with my purchase. Asus is a good manufacturer, and every aspect of the laptop is designed with performance in mind, it seems. It also works great for non-gaming uses, though if you're just looking for something to write e-mails, make documents, and browse the internet, it's going to be overkill. If you want to slay dragons in style, keep it under $2,000, and still have a beast of a machine, this is probably the laptop for you.if you want it to.

Powerful, attractive looking, and it runs all of my games smooth as butter. Unfortunately, less than 2 weeks after purchasing this product, the headphone jack went. Nothing but static and popping from the left side audio. For such an expensive purchase, I am disappointed that it has such a fault early into the life cycle. MSI support was less than helpful and was a poor experience overall. (Warranty covers shipping back to you only FYI) Considering how close the issue is to the purchase date, I have concerns with the overall quality and am strongly considering a return. It may be a minor issue. but if I paid this much and the support is poor I'd hate to see what they're like for a large issue.","7"

The computer itself is pretty awesome, other reviewers have said the touchpad has some lag to it but I don't really feel it(see edit). The computer is very powerful for gaming, and the display is absolutely gorgeous(although it has a rather wide bezel, doesn't bother me but I could see it might bother others) but does have a very small amount of light bleed on the bottom portion, which is normal for an super slim IPS panel like this one. The only time I notice it is when it is booting up. The weight is good, and the frame is nice and slim. The battery life is pretty low, don't buy this unless you expect to use it while charging 90% of the time. The battery is also not removable from the outside. I reinstalled windows 7 on here, and was happy to find good driver support on MSI's website. The M.2 drive used in the SSD upgrade was also one of the slower ones, you can see the specs at the end of this review.   http://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/396/SAMSUNG-MZNTD256HAGL-00000  **EDIT 8/26/2015**  Updated the review to 4 stars. Even though computer upgrade king breaks the warranty sticker that clearly states &#34;Warranty Sticker - Void if Tampered&#34; if you live in the U.S. MSI will honor their warranty even if the seal is broken for any original parts. Wish this was listed somewhere on the page. I've had this laptop for at least 6 months now and the touchpad and battery life are terrible. This is by far the worst touchpad I've ever used, and the battery will not even last an hour of idling with a couple word docs open and the lowest screen brightness. I bought this knowing that 90% of the time I'd be using it while charging as well as using an external mouse/keyboard but when I need to just take it somewhere real quick it's a nightmare. I know this is for gaming hence the battery and touchpad aren't meant to be used very frequently but it's a bummer when you just want to grab it and do some very basic stuff. The keyboard is actually surprisingly nice though, besides the fact that the windows key is off on the right side. I'm guessing this is so you wont hit it accidentally while gaming, which I've never had a problem with. More likely you will get bugged by touching the touchpad with your left hand while gaming, but you can turn the touchpad off by pressing FN + F3. most of the time I'm using this, I'm using a dual monitor USB 3.0 hub that works great. While this thing is plugged in and charging with my mouse and keyboard it's still extremely fast and very capable. The upside to this is that I can bring it to a friend and get setup, I can use it as a spare gaming rig for when people come over to my house, and even with the charging cable/mouse and other accessories it's not very heavy or cumbersome. Knocking off only 1 star for the touchpad and battery life because you should know going in that the battery will suck with any gaming PC.","8"

Starts amazingly quickly, even with no SSD. Can run any game I please, even on power saver, even though I've mostly been playing older ones. Whatever I run, it can handle it. Sleek and looks badass. It is extremely big, but if you don't realize that it is going to be before you receive it you aren't that smart. Doesn't get warm at all and is extremely quiet. Windows 8 is not bad, people make it sound worse than it is. It did get lost during shipping and took aver 2 weeks for them to find it, which pissed me off. But it all got resolved. It was poorly packaged, the original box was tattered to hell, which UPS just put in a bigger box and gave it a different tracking number without telling anybody. Bastards. But this thing is built like a tank. I love it. My battery lasts about 3-4 hours on average, depending on if I have music playing and the backlit keyboard on and whatnot. Also, my speakers are great. The subwoofer actually produces bass, not just tinny treble and strained mids/bass like other reviews say. They must have just been unlucky. iTunes is actually fast on this one, it's not even fast on most macs, I was delighted. My only complaints are as follows: 1- Sometimes I accidentally open the disk drive if I touch the left side. 2- That if you are not careful, the power supply input will fall out. It's incredible, in craftsmanship, processing capability and aesthetics. I also bought the ROG backpack Pulitzer to carry this puppy, and it's wonderful too. A perfect fit, and protects it very well. Portable Guy (the seller) was very good about getting back to me and helping me figure out what was going on with every mishap in shipping, and refunded me for shipping promptly when it didn't come in on time. (Especially worth noting because I had paid for 2-day air). I couldn't have made a better decision, I've messed with several laptops, but I always come out of it with an ASUS. You get what you pay for, and this is worth every penny.","5"

"B00NWE9RPA","Asus ROG G751JY 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7 4860H, 4 GB DDR3, 1TB HDD 7200 SSD With 256 GB RPM)","5","2015-02-28","Absolutley Awesome!","This computer is by far the best computer that I have owned to date, and I do not say that lightly! I am coming from a 15' MacBook Pro to this monster, so I can testify to the over all quality of the laptop.<br /><br />When I started looking for a replacement for my MBP (it was stolen) I was initially drawn right back to the Apple computer, as they have always had flawless design and I have never encountered a problem with them, however I wanted a bit more power then what was being offered by the MBP.<br /><br />After reading every review here on Amazon and countless other reviews out there and watching many videos on it I decided to go for this computer.<br /><br />Price wise this computer was costing about as much as the top end Mac Laptop except with the 17' screen as opposed to the 15' screen and much better GPU.<br /><br />First impression of this laptop, it is beautiful! I am used to the sleek, elegant and sturdy design of the MBP so I was worried that I would be disappointed with the build quality of G751JY. I am not! This computer feels as well put together as the MBP (not solid aluminum like MBP though), the single metal hing that holds lid is very sturdy and the top of the computer is made out of some mat rubber/plastic that feels very durable but also looks amazing!<br /><br />Once you open the laptop, you get to see the beautiful ROG style red backlit keyboard with the computers very large trackpad! The keyboard feels amazing, especially coming from a laptop! It is very responsive and even though it is a laptop computer it has a good bit of fall built into it. The trackpad is also very nice! I was actually surprised by it. It is quite large and supports quite a few built in gestures very similar to the MBP though it is not AS responsive as the mac trackpad, it is still one of the better trackpads I have encountered on a laptop.<br /><br />As for the screen, wow! I was a bit uncertain at first because the MBP 15' comes with the Retna Display so I was a bit skeptical of the ROG's 17' not living up to the quality. However, this screen is amazing! It is bright, great color, vibrant and HUGE! It is simply fantastic!<br /><br />As for the audio, many reviews that I read or watched sad that it was terrible, but to be honest, I think it is fantastic! Now granted if you try and compare any laptop audio to an expensive sound system or a $200+ headset, then you deserve to be disappointed. The speakers on this thing go up incredibly loud! I have actually never tested them at full volume simple because I have not needed to. For anyone that is going to actually use this laptop as a laptop and travel with it, will either have their own pair of $200+ headphones or will be happy with the build in audio.<br /><br />Ok, so with a laptop of this power/size, you would expect noise to be a factor. I did. I expected it to get quite loud wile under load. Well, thats not the case. This thing is SUPER quite! It made my MBP sound like a jet in comparison. I have never noticed the noise on this at all, and I usually work with it sitting on my lap as opposed to a designated desk so the ventilation is probably not as optimal as it could be in that position. And in line with noise, is the heat factor. Like I mentioned, I work with this sitting on my lap (its a laptop after all) and I have never had it get even noticeably warm, just doing simple things my MBP would get so hot that I was constantly worried about it, but not this thing!! ASUS did a fantastic job with the heat management system on this beast!<br /><br />Now, for performance, this thing has taken EVERYTHING I have thrown at it and haply asked for more! It is an absolute beast when it comes to getting any and every job done, I literally do not know what you could throw at it that would even put a stutter in its step! This thing starts up from a complete shutdown 10x faster than most computers take to come out of sleep. I am more than happy at its performance, it is way more than I expected! In my experience so far, the battery life is as advertised, about 4 hours, and it works well if you dim the screen and minimize power consumption, so far I have been more than happy with the battery life, especially on such a monster as this!<br /><br />And last but not least, size! This thing is an absolute MONSTER!! I have never owned a 17' laptop before and definitely not a high performance one like this, but never the less this thing was WAY bigger than anything I could have predicted! Now granted, for all the hardware that this thing has packed inside and how powerful it is, I would not say that it is too big, but just do not expect something that you can easily carry to a coffee shop. I mentioned above that I work with this thing on my lap, and I do so very comfortably, but I am also a larger than average guy, so the size and weight are about proportional in my opinion, but I definitely know quite a few people that would have trouble carrying this thing around, and most people would want a designated desk for it. The power brick is also VERY large, its well, about the size and weight of an actual brick :P<br /><br />I know that many reviews had specific problems with their computers, such as screen issues or seemingly loos parts inside; I have experienced none of these issues whatsoever, and it simply could be that those issues were a few isolated cases that occurred right at release of the product that ASUS has since taken care of. I would not hesitate to recommended this computer to family or friends (however I would first seriously question their need for such a monster).<br /><br />Good shopping and I hope this helped!","15"

Rebooting/turning off has no effect. No warning. Shut the machine down last night; woke up at 4AM to find the machine powered on and in the setup utility.  Less than 90 days from purchase; Xmas present, so only 65 days from unboxing/first use.  BUT return service ran out on Jan 31. Amazon customer service suggested I contact ASUS directly, and kindly offered a 20% refund to help pay for the repair and shipping costs. They also offered a 70% refund if I returned the machine to them, but since other reviews show that ASUS has dealt with this problem before, I took the 20%. Note: if you buy this enormous machine, you will not be able to fit it into a regular laptop bag; only a bag that fits an 18&#34; laptop, which will run you about $180 for a decent one. Not a wise purchase; look elsewhere.","2"

"B00KD5DUR2","Lenovo Y50 Performance Gaming Laptop - DOORBUSTER","2","2015-03-05","The touchpad is garbage. If you are considering the Y50","It's fast, however there are some issues with the 860M graphics card and compatibility with some software.  The touchpad is garbage.  If you are considering the Y50, spend the few extra bucks and get it configured with the SSD.  I wound up purchasing an SSD b/c the WD drive that comes with this model is a dog!  Besides the graphics card and the touchpad, this is a great machine.  A bit on the pricey side, but it is very fast.  I'm on the fence about recommending this machine.  I have owned other Lenovo laptops in the past.  For me, they seem to last, and are very durable.  This unit feels rugged and well built...SOLID.  The issues with the touchpad and video card however took the gratification grin right off of my face from the get go. Update 4/13/15  The video issues remain unsolved, and now I have discovered that the widi does not connect correctly.  When it does connect, it drops the resolution to 1366X768.  After connection to external display, it will only remain connected for 2 or 3 minutes.  I have tried this with 3 different external devices.  I have contacted both Lenovo and Intel.  Both companies point the finger at each other and run the customer around in circles.  Lenovo customer service is garbage.  They usually disconnect their call when they can't come up with an answer and take weeks to respond.  They expect the end user to send their machine in over seas for repairs at customer expense.  Over 100.00 to ship to asia and back.  4 to 6 week turn around time.  Another issue that I mentioned above it the touchpad.  It is flaky at best.  There are a lot of posts in forums that have the same issue I have.  The right and left click only works about 50 percent of the time.  Lenovo's response is to have the touchpad assembly replaced.  Again, user pays shipping back and forth to Asia and 4 to 6 week turn around time.  I am currently working with the seller and if necessary with Amazon for a replacement.  IF your unit is not perfect out of the box, send it back immediately.  My unit is now almost 2 months old, for a 1200.00 laptop, I really expected more.  I am very disappointed.  My old laptop was a Lenovo U430 and that machine never failed.  I wish I didn't sell it to buy this one!!   8/18/2015 Six months later, two replacement touchpads from Lenovo, and it's still not functioning correctly.  Amazon and the seller refuse to exchange the unit stating that it's all on the manufacturer.  This is a crap deal from both Amazon and the seller.  You would think that a 1500.00 laptop would be covered in some way shape or from from either Amazon, the seller or the manufacturer.  I am getting the run around from all 3 and I have a non usable hunk of junk.","5"

On arrival, CPUID indicated my CPU was running at only 2.4 GHz ASUS customer support had me install &#34;Power4Gear Hybrid&#34; and set for &#34;Performance&#34; CPUID (also a free download) confirms OC to 3.5 GHz. Also, set Nvidia Control Panel &#62; 3D Settings &#62; Set PhysX Configuration &#62; Select a PhysX Processor to GeForce GTX 980M  With these changes I am getting dramatically better results than my Alienware 17 (which cost $1,200 more)!!  Alienware 17 benchmarks Firestrike Standard at 5400 with 880M card and 8 GB of video RAM and OC to 4.0 GHz (otherwise same specs) ASUS benchmarks Firestrike Standard at 8600 with 980M card and 4 GB of video RAM and OC to 3.5 GHz (otherwise same specs)  Note that it might take time - it did for me - to enable some of your pre-Windows 8 games. Some required action beyond just changing compatibility in properties or &#34;Run as Administrator&#34;.   Luckily Google and the discussion boards are filled with people facing these challenges.   I've now got this rig to run every game I own - whether Steam, Origin or Uplay.  Looking ahead this system will do well with new games.  Games written for a Win 8 environment.  In case you are wondering why I have an Alienware 17 AND an ASUS 17... the Alienware died at 6 months.  Had to slug it out with Dell via the Better Business Bureau to get resolution.  Took more than 2 months of constant battering on them.  Got the full refund, refund of warranty, etc.  I'm done with Dell and Alienware for this century.  Ultimately, this ASUS costs $1,200 less than my Dell - but performs better via 3DMark (and ease of set up).  Go figure. Cloud saves allow all my games to pick up with the ASUS where I left off with the Alienware.  Happy Amazon gave me this option.  Thanks! .","4"

Someone recommended giving it a static IP and going with Intel drivers would make it work better (and maybe so), but for what I paid I feel this should work like a champ right out of the box. I find I'm not using it all that much as the mobility is the chief reason I shelled out the money to begin with (to have a mobile gaming device). Outside the wifi issue, it's a great laptop.  I have an HP laptop that I bought a couple of years ago that I cannot game with but can stream videos (for example). I use that much more.

One thing to note is that the disks are not partitioned well. Since you have the limit of just 4 primary partitions, it's a little difficult to create more partitions (at least i couldn't or didn't put the effort into it).<br />They should have had the caps-lock LED on the Caps-Lock instead of putting it near the power/battery/disk indicator.<br />The power adapter should have some indicator saying it's connected to the outlet... in case the outlet is faulty or the adapter is unplugged altogether.","0"

The specs were KILLER; which is why I ordered it.<br />Organization Problems: Before ordering this computer.... Google &#34;Asus fn keys&#34;; what you'll find is either they are NOT working AT ALL or that nearly EVERYONE wants to change the arrangement! The arrangement of the keys is soooo obtuse: for instance, the function(fn) key is in the location the CTRL key would normally extend to, so when trying to copy something, I end up launching the Camera! You can Only imagine how 1. Annoying that is, 2. much it interrupts my work flow, 3. wastes my TIME! What's worse? Then I want to re-configure the fn keys so this doesn't happen... finding out how to do this online is JUST as frustrating! Hey ASUS; news flash: DON'T PRE SET THE FUNCTION KEYS, LET THE USERS DO THAT OURSELVES!!! Setting fn keys at the top row is fine, but associating them with general keys is a HAZARD! Don't get it wrong, this notebook isn't like, &#34;the worst of all time&#34;, but I certainly cannot recommend it other than for it's cool hardware design.<br />It should also be noted that Windows 8.1 is ATTROCIOUS (not totally Asus' fault lol)! The start page is an eyesore and is exceedingly cumbersome! Whenever you want to search the desktop the results spectacle out into a full sceen! What IDIOT thought this was a good idea?!?!?! The Start menu is completely replaced by this obtuse sprawling of apps most people will NEVER USE! UGH... I have ALWAYS been a Windows fan... until I experience Windows 8.1. THEE worst Windows experience I could imagine! The interface is optimized to slow you down and waste your time! As a software developer, this is nearly comPletely unusable!!!","6"

Okay the unit is big. Like, really big. They send a really nice backpack with it. If you don't put the notebook in it then you could always use it to carry around a toddler, maybe two toddlers. The wrist rest is nice, but it's pretty damn heavy, but you can always use it to beat someone with in a self-defense situation. When you use the fan switch to turn up the fans full blast you fully expect the machine to lift up off the desk and hover, but hopefully they don't run like that too much during gaming. The keyboard is very good, although, admittedly, it's going to take a little time to get accustomed to the key travel. I do like the mouse very much, quite smooth as is scrolling. You can also configure it for scroll momentum and it just keeps scrolling until you touch to stop it. The computer is heavy, but given it's size it's not as heavy as you'd think when you're toting it. It boots up super fast and generally feels well made and solid. Screen looks great. I'll post some more after I've tried some demanding games with the unit. It came with a code to download Witcher 3 (which isn't supposed to come out for at least another month so i'll see if I can download it). I'll update later.  Update: had it a few days now and it works very well. The fans do get a bit noisy on graphically intensive games. Witcher 2 is silky smooth all settings maxed out And that's a pretty graphically intensive game. The keyboard is outstanding for typing but takes some getting used to. I recommend getting a 21 inch wheeled duffle to tote this baby through the airport. Given the weight of the unit plus power supply I can't see lugging it through the terminal on my shoulder. The upside of the weight though is that the screen is monstrously large! Contact me if you have questions and I'll do my best to help. Oh BTW it does come with a coupon for Witcher 3 but it is very confusing as to how to redeem it and you ultimately are taken to GOG.com to redeem it. Also you must mail in a card to get your gold WASD keys. They do no not come in the box, at least they didn't come in mine.","14"

It doesn't get as incredibly hot as some other systems I've used.<br /><br />Notes:<br />* SSD version has all the OS on SSD and starts up fast. First ever restart took 45 seconds (after I installed the 3 things I didn't want including McAfee, and WebStorage)<br />* Hard disk (1TB) pre-separated into two partitions<br />* Not a touchscreen, but most touchscreens I've seen don't have the same quality.<br />* Perfect viewing from any angle, even from the extreme sides<br />* Keyboard includes small bump on &#34;W&#34; so you don't lose finger placement during online WASD games<br />* Comes with a few pre-installed apps that I removed, including TripAdvisor, Netflix, Games - you might keep Netflix, but I use Amazon Prime instead. Interestingly also come with LINE - most popular messenger in Japan - which is weird, because I've almost never seen it used in America<br />* Price to value is incredible, I haven't found a better deal on Amazon yet.

As I am a hardcore online gamer I knew I had to upgrade to SSD and 32GB fast RAM. The cover to access the hard drives and ram has changed and is not as easy to open. A flimsy piece of rubber covers a screw and then you need something like a credit card to pop it open. Upon examination the drives were easily accessible but the first 2 sticks of RAM were not. Nor was the wifi card accessible for upgrading. Also, there is no way to remove the battery! I called ASUS and asked a lot of questions, with not much help, especially since the two times I called I had difficulty understanding the broken English that I was hearing. But I was told there is no way to replace the battery. The G74SX was a great design, this G751JT however is disappointingly not.<br /><br />If you're not planning on making any upgrades the rest of the reviews praise this machine and I say go for it.<br /><br />However if you're hardcore this won't meet your upgrading desires.  MSI equivalents for some reason didn't seem that impressive to me so I think I will pony up some extra and have my next  laptop come from Origin PC, the original developers of the once mighty Alienware.<br /><br />I cannot review any further as I didn't even power it up but instead boxed it up for return.","2"

Why is it every Microsoft Windows revision includes wholesale moving around and in many cases hiding the same features and commands?  Update 12/16/2016 - I have returned this to repair the touchpad under warranty.  This week (about 18 months since purchase), the hinge assembly (both hinges) has come apart completely - piece by piece.  I have never seen a catastrophic failure of hinges like this with any laptop.  It turns out the entire assembly is anchored into the plastic back cover of the LCD display.  This is clearly a design defect - of course metal screws and anchors would pull through plastic (picture uploaded).  I reported this to Lenovo - so far, no response.  Now this display is completely separated from the keyboard. I am changing my rating to 1-star.  I bought Lenovo b/c it bought out IBM.","1"

It likely has good reliability and the lights make it go faster, or something.<br /><br />As a brief history lesson: Alienware, before and for a time after being acquired by Dell, used all-aluminum in their chassis construction. While purists scoff at how things have changes in the past 3-4 years, the fact is that this particular Alienware 14 uses aluminum where it counts, and other fine-to-the-touch materials in other places.

I repeat, no Google services or Apple apps have a windows app store version not even YouTube. the display screen looks washed out. I tried everything but it still looks washed out compared to my previous $300 dell laptop. Wi-Fi is so slow I don't know why. I've tried updating drivers to no avail. overall I'd say spec wise, design and performance, this is the best sub $1000 laptop you can get. that beautiful backlit keyboard is a huge plus.","0"

I did my due diligence, read a lot of reviews and this was supposed to be the best bang for the buck. This was to be a Christmas gift for my son. Got it, wrapped it and on Christmas say he got his new laptop. Unfortunately, it was DOA. Charged it overnight, tried turning it on, got a few status lights to flicker, and that was it. Just a dead brick.  Returned it and and got a replacement. Ok, charged it up, and all was good, until trying to use the wifi. It wold pick up a few networks, he would log onto ours, and then it would die after 5-10 minutes. No networks seen at all, in fact, if you checked the settings, it would come up with This device is not working. Reboot and repeat. Sent it back. Unfortunately, they had no more to send, so after a half dozen phone calls to Amazon, and wait times over half an hour, I darn near hit a brick wall. After speaking with a supervisor, they sent the one with the SS hard drive. Less storage, but what the heck. I am not a gamer, so this review is entirely based on the fact that I got two useless laptops. The jury is still out on the third one. Time will tell.","10"

It takes a lot of effort to get a PC right.  Laptops are even harder to pull off correctly.  The G751JY-DH72X has some shortcomings, but overall it's the best windows laptop I have ever owned.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />Screen<br />The screen is clear and looks great.  The viewing angles are good and resolution is good.  Some people complained that this laptop didn't come with a 4K display.  Those people are flapping their lips without thinking it through.  To run a 4K display in a game setting would require two or three high end graphics cards.  That's not feasible in a laptop.  Also, if you can tell the difference between 1080p and 4K on a 17&#34; screen, you must be part eagle.<br /><br />Power<br />This thing is a beast.  It can run almost anything out there at a rate of 50+ FPS.  To pull that off in a laptop that costs under 3K is amazing.<br /><br />Card Reader<br />Why is this in here?  Because of how well they designed it.  You can take a standard SD card, put it into the slot, and it clicks in.  It's also flush to the side of the laptop.  Often the card sticks out of a card reader.  This is impressive because this allows you to basically add a third, high speed, hard drive.  For $80 you can have an additional 256 gigs of storage.<br /><br />User Upgrades<br />By taking out one screw on the back, you can access the service port.  In here you can swap out the blu-ray drive with a hard drive caddie, swap out the hard drives, or replace the memory.  That's a great bonus in a laptop.<br /><br />Ports<br />They did not skimp on the ports.  I love that.  There are plenty of USB 3 ports, a VGA, a Thunder Bolt, and more.  That gives this machine a big boost on it's flexibility.<br /><br />Heat<br />It's simply amazing that they manage to keep this laptop cool.  Granted, the back of the laptop looks like an afterburner, but it does an amazing job,<br /><br />Design<br />There are a lot of small tweaks in the design of this laptop.  For instance, the keyboard slopes towards you, instead of laying flat.  That makes it more comfortable to use.  The more you use this, the more you realize that someone spent a lot of time trying to get it right.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Sound<br />This is a very minor con.  I really don't care the speakers on a laptop.  I use ear buds or a headset.  I think most people do, especially if they are traveling.  If you want to use the speakers for watching movies or listening to music, you will be somewhat disappointed.  The quality is only marginal.<br /><br />Windows 8.1<br />This doesn't detract from the number of stars, because it's not Asus's fault.  Windows 8.1 is not good.  I really hate it. It takes too much effort to get from one place to another or a lot of tweaking to put shortcuts in.  Hopefully windows 10 will be better.<br /><br />Back Lighting<br />The back lighting is cool, but there are some annoying aspects to it.  First you can't change the color.  Second it's on a timer.  I'd rather they did it like Apple.  Apple lets you set it and forget it.  It'll only shut off the Mac powers off, goes to sleep, or you turn the back lighting off.  With this laptop, if you stop typing, within a few minutes the back lighting shuts off.<br /><br />No Recovery Disc<br />I know this is a small thing, but it's annoying to have to create your own recovery disc.  How much does on blu-ray or DVD cost?  Instead I have to use one of my USB flash drives.<br /><br />That's it.  The cons are small with this rig.  Overall it's a great gaming laptop.  It also looks better, costs less, and matches the performance of the MSI equivalent rig.ign of this laptop.  For instance, the keyboard slopes towards you, instead of laying flat.

One major complaint, NO OPTICAL DRIVE!  I even contacted the Amazon sales support and they assured me, it has an DVD. Two minor complaints; It could use a couple more USB ports.  It could use an audio input jack, for those of us with microphone/headsets.  *** Updated 04/16/2016  I've been using the laptop for gaming for sixteen months now and I need to replace the keyboard.  A word of advice, invest in the cooling pad.  The processor automatically goes into &#34;turbo&#34; mode, when there is demand for more processing speed.  This sounds suspiciously like over-clocking.

Did i mention the price. For what you get with this laptop, this is one of the best deals i could find. Will i regret not ponying up a few hundred dollars extra for something with better specs? Maybe. But for the money this laptop is hard to beat.    Build Quality:  The build quality is very good. This is a solid feeling laptop that is surprisingly thin. I'm not in love with the keyboard but that being said i don't hate it either; the same goes for the track pad. Honestly, the only track-pad I found to work perfectly is on a mac book so i wasn't expecting perfection anyway. I've played hours of games with this on my lap and it has never become uncomfortably hot.    Gaming:  This is the reason you're most likely going to buy this laptop. I've done a decent amount of gaming on this laptop and it has performed beautifully thus far. To see what I've played check out http://progamerreviews.com. One important thing to be aware of: in order to get the best performance out of the laptop you may need to go to the Nvidia Control Panel and make sure your games are set to use the Nvidia card and not the terrible Intel integrated graphics.    The Screen:  Not good but tolerable. I haven't changed it out and I'm not sure I will. Bottom line is it could be much better but isn't a deal breaker. Here's what annoys me the most about the screen.  1. Contrast / brightness  2. Sharpness. I've noticed a certain fuzziness to Windows I've never noticed before.    **** Lenovo Installed Software (ADWARE): Please be aware that Lenovo loads this laptop with a TON of garbage. I've come to expect this from OEMs so my default first action with any new PC is to remove it all and run several virus / adware scans. According to Engadget (http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/19/lenovo-superfish-adware-preinstalled/) this laptop has a particularly bad piece of adware installed by default so BE CAREFUL! ****    Overall:  So far I don't have any regrets buying this laptop. For the price to performance ration it's hard to beat.","5"

After registering I called the service number provided on the registration screen and was told that it was a software glitch that I caused and I would have to spend $300.00 to buy a service plan to fix it. After asking for a supervisor I was told that they were a third party provider.

"B00IKF2H12","ASUS ROG G750JM 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [OLD VERSION]","4","2015-02-18","This laptop performed much better than I expected","This laptop performed much better than I expected. Most of the negative reviews are very innacurate. The laptop is heavy...but not extremely heavy it fit in my cheap 17&#34; laptop bag without a hassle. And I carried it comfortably all day.<br /><br />Now the performance...<br /><br />I was able to run Space engineers, Far cry 3, Sleeping Dogs, GTA 4, Counterstrike Global Offence, Fallout New Vegas, and Staints Row 4, on Ultra settings at full resolution. The lowest frame rate I ever got was 34.2fps and that was because I was playing with antiailising on and vsync.<br /><br />There is one small con about this laptop that can be disorienting to others. When you play your game's, MAKE SURE you right click the shortcut and that you select &#34;Set Nvidia graphics card&#34; as default GPU. If you don't then sometimes it will use your integrated graphics as default.<br /><br />Noise....<br />I'm not sure if its just my unit but I have seen a lot of complaints about the laptop being loud. That was not the case with mine. It was very quiet throughout my gameing day. I was even able to work on some 3D artwork and render it in cinema 4d for 8 hours and still didn't hear the fans kick on or have my lap burnd like others are describing.<br /><br />All in all this laptop is worth the bang for your buck. However if I had to nitpick one last thing, it would be that the laptops CPU and GPU are soldered onto the mother board which throws the future proof card out from the window. :( On a positive note it should last you for years.

Look no further.","I purchased this as a desktop replacement to tide me over until i build my next desktop rig. I opted for the ssd, its fast but id say the 7200 rpm 1tb isnt much slower if you decide to go that route.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />- usb 3.0 all the way<br />- easy to convert optical drive to another hdd or sdd via a caddy<br />- 16 gigs of ram!<br />- 860m video card does a respectable job<br />- i7 quadcore makes multitasking a breeze<br />- two video outs allow me to keep my current dual screen desktop setup without forcing me to use the subpar screen on this<br />- backlit keyboard looks sweet when i actually use this as a lappy. Its also the best 15&#34; laptop keyboard ive ever used. It even has a full numberpad.<br /><br />THE INDIFFERENT:<br />- screen isnt the best but its acceptable for the times it wont be connected to my dual screen setup<br />- trackpad has no physical buttons, making it nearly impossible to game. Its decent at websurfing tho and ill be using my mouse when gaming anyways.<br />- without backlight, the keys are hard to discern from eachother. Usually not an issue but kinda annoying when trying to conserve power when not plugged in<br />- the variety of video outs are pretty annoying especially if you have an older monitor. Thankfully adapters are pretty cheap theythese days.<br />- this i7 is great at tackling lots of little things at once but not the best at larger demanding programs.<br />THE BAD:<br /><br />- 3 usb ports. Youll have to get a powered usb hub if you are like me and want to use it as a desktop replacement. One more would have gone a long way with me.<br />- not a huge fan of the cooling system (no pun intended) and cooling pads dont help much on this laptop due to the way they created the cooling system. No emergency shutdowns yet tho but im worried about the longhaul.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Its a well rounded package that should sate the average gamers needs and with a little setup and a couple accessories, it makes for a decent desktop replacement.  i look forward to getting a year or two out of it as a desktop replacement until i build my desktop and a few years after that as a laptop, gaming on the go, or as a backup.

At 15.6 inches, it fits easily into most backpacks. The large hard drive and 16 GB of memory, plus the 860M make it a monster of a machine. The matte screen looks nice, though some applications and windows that aren't optimized for it (?) look a little out-of-focus from time to time. Battery life is pretty good for everyday use, considering the power needed and screen size. I only have three gripes with it: 1) the metallic surfacing picks up fingerprints like CRAZY, and it's hard to get them out; 2) the trackpad is really cheap, and hard to use -- make sure you get a wireless mouse; 3) the screen's brightness, even when at the lowest setting, is still really bright -- especially if you're in a totally dark room.<br /><br />Would I recommend this product?

It's a glass cannon.","Pros: +Powerful for the price +Lightweight  Cons: -Not much HD space -Overheats and shuts down -Integrated chip is set as the default graphics display instead of the actual Nvidea graphics card (Wtf guys?!?) -Position of ports -Not very many USB ports -Very poor cooling system and fan, hence the overheating problem  Summary:  This laptop has two display components inside of a tiny laptop with a very small vent to cool with. Let that sink in for a second. It has a ton of power, and no way to cool it. The Intel Display also FIGHTS with the Nvidia Display for graphical control of whats going on with your laptop. It's a very poor design. Every other computer seems to have some software to govern this smartly, automatically. This one doesn't (seem to).  I've owned this laptop since January 2015. As of today, im buying a replacement computer, because I can't deal with this one anymore. The Nvidia display is failing. Graphics drivers just uninstalled themselves yesterday, and I spent all day reformatting and trying to get my laptop back to where it should be. And it still has issues with HDMI, and its other integrated display.   My best description of this laptop is it being likened to a glass cannon. It's powerful, but it crumbles under its own weight.  Do not get this laptop. If you NEED a laptop, ASUS is very good. But spend a few extra hundred bucks, and get something that has a resounding 5 star review. If you want to keep at this budget of 900-1200, get a desktop.  I love ASUS, but they just dropped the ball on this laptop. STAY AWAY!US ROG..  But if this caps out at your budget, and you're willing to put up with some quirks, this is very very powerful for the cost.  I spent another 40$ on a cooling pad for the laptop and it still overheats and shuts off..... Save up some extra money and buy the next one up  - MAKE SURE IT HAS A PROPER COOLING SYSTEM!","5"

The only areas where this laptop lacks are the hard drive size (I have an external so it's not a big deal), and maybe the graphics card, it should be able to keep up with current games for a couple more years, but after that, an upgrade might be needed.

One had a screen DOA and was sent back.  They sold out; so I bought an MSI GS60 Ghost instead.  Here's my review for the GL551 I kept.<br /><br />Pros:  FAST processor and other specs.  Nice keyboard.  Cool lid.  Reliable so far.  Seems like quality. Good battery life.<br />Cons: Mouse pad blows.  Power button is a little crooked.  Number pad is unnecessary.  Makes a harsh click sound when powering up by the CD drive.<br /><br />There is a newer version of this model out with better specs, but this one has a nice solo 256 SSD setup.  The new one still has RPMs in both setups.<br /><br />Final Thought:  This is a great computer, but I bought it for $1,029, and it has since gone up to $1,149.  I would rather go with another MSI Ghost or wait for the ASUS G501JW to come down in price a bit for that kind of cash, but if this computer falls to $1,029 again, it's definitely worth it.","0"

I'm a huge gamer so this works well for me. Been a Asus customer for a while and it did out perform my old G72GX model.<br /><br />Pros: Sweet graphics card. Played some nice games with highest settings and it performed flawlessly. One example being Skyrim. Maxed and with plenty of mods yet no slowing down. Amazing air flow; the graphics card didn't get very hot due to its design to max cooling making sure your game doesn't slow down nor the graphics card dying early due to heat which is huge for me because I get nervous when things get too hot in a computer that has tight space. 1920x1080 resolution is amazing. Neat design, Like is exterior a lot.<br /><br />Cons: Typical Asus to lack some extra buttons that make life easier (Like special buttons for music located elsewhere not on the fn keys) Bulky, Heavy, Asus customer service isn't great. &#34;Slow start up&#34;<br /><br />Overlooking Cons:<br />-Lacking special buttons like volume (you have to use fn keys to change it quickly) is annoying but being an Asus user, I never noticed but others I've let use this computer notice so if you're into that take that into mind.<br />-The bulkiness is an issue but if you know how gamin laptops work. This isn't an issue and if you appreciate what it has to offer.<br />-Same with weight, more weight isn't bad it just means you get more power with your computer. The alternative to this is bringing a huge computer that can weight way more while also carrying a monitor, and wires, or this 10 pound thing. (granted desktops have more power but that's not the point)<br />-Asus's customer service is practically non existent however I've never dealt with this problem because I never go to them but if your someone who needs that and can't over look it then you may want to find another maker (however Computer upgrade King seem to make that problem go away)<br />-I don't suffer from slow start ups because I go to run&#62;msconfig&#62; uncheck useless programs.<br /><br />In all honesty this is a great product. I do fear the price is a bit high but it made me feel secure about buying it. I am a little picky with where they put the mic and headphone ports but I've adapted. Some think its design is a little bland but it's not an issue with me since its simple but works.<br /><br />Tips for those buying a gaming laptop for the first time: This is a great start. If you want cheaper that's fine but don't expect greatness for under $1,000 for a powerful machine. It may be heavy when you carrying it around all day but if you want a beast machine like this, its not going to be very light. Don't complain about battery life while gaming, just don't. Games eat power like nothing and if you make it perform to highest settings that eats even more power.","0"

I write heavy duty OpenCL, database, and graphical applications, run several virtual machines, have a full-blown Visual Studio 2013 install... this computer works for a living.  I can OpenCL both video processors, BTW.  Performance: Excellent. Chews numbers like a champ. IFS 1920x1080 screen: Fabulous. Well worth the extra cost. 3D Games: I only play Guild Wars 2, but it runs at 40-100fps (depending on scene) at max resolution and all graphics options on. SSD: Could be bigger, but I can live with 120G.  The 1TB drive comes partitioned into two 500GB halves, BTW.  I don't know why people are complaining about the trackpad - it works great for this one-handed man. I like this trackpad better than the ones on my older Dell and HP laptops.  My only complaint is the keyboard backlight. The red light isn't as bright as I'd like, especially at low angle. I use a laptop caddy that tilts, so this hasn't been too much trouble, just annoying. The keys are very unreadable when the backlight is off.  Original review  I purchased this system as a development machine, and I haven't been disappointed.  One VERY annoying glitch: When starting the machine, the keyboard backlight comes on briefly, then turns off as Windows 8.1 boots. I'm then forced to type in my Windows password on dark keys that are almost unreadable. Once the password is typed, the keyboard backlight comes back on. No, the Fn keys do nothing until a Windows password is entered. VERY ANNOYING in an otherwise perfect machine.  Found a solution at: http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/keyboard-light-fix-gary-key.513264/page-5  Not for a non-techie. For me, easy.","8"

You'd think with this hefty price tag they could have at least added the extra 2GB to complete it.<br /><br />Some of the good points on this are<br /><br />Study build, could have been lighter though, but that's where the new slimmer model is getting releases soon, but it's overpriced if you asked me.<br /><br />The keyboard feels really right for your comfort and needs, not to mention a ROG mouse was also included.<br /><br />Its technically overkill for a laptop to have a 16GB RAM, but I'm not complaining - it's great but you'll most end up using mostly 8GB.

I am buying the model with the SSD and IPS display. I can't believe Asus would put such an awful screen in a $1099 laptop. Any SLIGHT change in viewing angle distorts the picture to where it gives you a headache. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $200 for the SSD/IPS screen model if you are on the fence. But overall it performs well with games and I'm sure I can update this to a 5 star rating once I get my hands on the upgraded model. If I'm paying over $1000 for a laptop, I need to be satisfied, the DS71 did not do that, but I'm sure the upgraded model will address all of my current issues.","9"

No HDD detected at boot. Boot sequence fails immediately. I opened BIOS and it isn't detecting a drive at all. If this were a computer that I had no other options with, I would crack the sucker open and fix whatever is wrong. It's probably a loose SATA cable or similar, but seeing as this is DOA, I'm not touching it - not my problem.  I'll return it and find a different reseller.

If you're using this as a Adobe CC workstation, or intend on doing graphic design / video production work, get ready to tweak your interface scale settings. You'll know what I mean when you get there..  The other thing you'll want to be ready for are some odd LCD defects in the form of blotches. If this doesn't apply to your machine, disregard.  If it does, get a replacement. My blotch was tricky. Luckily it was dead center on my screen, and I could only really see it on white/light gray backgrounds, but yours might be more obvious on Red/Blue/Green/DarkGray backgrounds.

I had originally been planning on purchasing the Thermaltake Massive TM but, just as I was about to click that wonderful PURCHASE button I started considering my pc's lackluster internal speakers.  After reading several reviews that listed the airflow differences between the two units as negligible and the good reviews on the aspects of the design/output of the audio of the SP I had a last minute change of plans.  As always, let's begin the review with shipping/packaging.  The product arrived in clean, secure, and professional packaging ahead of delivery schedule.  As a side point, I am LOVING this free shipping with PRIME membership.  Upon opening the package I found that the device was enclosed in a top notch box that is exactly what you would get at the brick and mortar/big box store.  The box was factory sealed and was free from dirt or defect.  Opened the product box and the unit was wrapped in a plastic layer to keep it dry during shipping.  Also included is a USB cable(this one is a Y formation--good for user), a standard 3.5 mm audio cable to run from your headphone plug in to the cooler, and the directions/warranty card.  I found that there is NO need for the directions.  This unit is super simple....just like I wanted.  The top surface of the cooler (where you place your laptop) has 4 non slip rubber feet that keep my computer from sliding down as I type...they work great.  I use this unit in conjunction with an older Toshiba Tecra M11 series that has a tendency to run so hot that it shuts down when playing games.  This cooler kept me from overheating EVER!  The temps during the hardest core gaming that my system can accommodate were kept approximately 40-50 degrees F cooler than without the unit.  I won't go into detail on the features of the unit as they can be found on the amazon/manufacturer page.  Here are a few of the things that I thought were great about the unit...  the bright blue led has an on/off switch that comes in handy in the dark.  The unit has an extra usb port to make up for the one that it requires to draw power from your pc.  The on off switch for the fan and the speaker system is integrated into the unit in a sleek way....the chrome accent/speaker guard that look like accent pieces are functional switches.<br />Summary: This unit is highly functional and has a sleek/cool look to it as well.  You get a sound system that is what you wished your laptop sounded like along with a GREAT laptop cooler.  I have been using this for approx one week and have had no issues with heat.  For the price, you get a top notch cooler with a solid performing sound system. GREAT BUY!","4"

I am using it to protect a brand new keyboard as the original keyboard (with no protection) began failing before a year was up. It progressively got worse until even my space key stopped working so I had to replace it.<br /><br />Most noticeable is that this protector perfectly fits the keyboard on my ASUS G750JX-DB71 17&quot; laptop.<br /><br />It is thin enough I can use the keys without much interruption but thick enough I am not afraid of it ripping. It does take a little getting used to but if I just ignore it and use the keys like I always have I can forget it is even there. When you look down at the keys you will notice it is slightly cloudy but you can still easily tell which key is which.<br /><br />Do not throw out the little pieces of 2-sided tape included in the package. They were taped to a piece of cardboard in the package, Basically stick them wherever you think will be best to help keep the cover in place over the keyboard. That is what you'll see in the photo below the space bar, number keys, and fn key.<br /><br />I would definitely prefer not needing a keyboard protector like this but it just isn't an option with this model laptop- the keyboard seems very susceptible to dust, crumbs, and other small pieces of debris- more so than any other keyboards I have used before.<br /><br />Update: It has been just over a week and all remains good. In fact I've adjusted to it I don't even realize it's there anymore. It's just like typing on a normal keyboard with a sort of anti-slip grip on the keys.<br /><br />------------------<br />ReOrdered February 2016 - Different Model - 3 Stars (at best.)<br /><br />Note- the newer version of this is worse. The overhang around the edge is much less, keys on the outside are barely protected, dirt will get in, Also, there is no 2-sided sticky tape to keep it in place. It's also not as clear and doesn't feel as smooth. Unfortunately there is no way to differentiate between the two it seems, be aware the original purchase item was $29, all the current ones list for $9.99 or less. It would have been worth it to me to pay more for the superior product.<br /><br />However, in both cases they perfectly fit my keyboard for the ASUS 750.<br /><br />Note 2: Photo is of original (older) item.Unfortunately there is no way to differentiate between the two it seems, be aware the original purchase item was $29, all the current ones list for $9.99 or less.

The internal fans can spin up and be quite loud even when the machine isn't under load. The fans turn on and off as required so it isn't a constant noise and the machine can be almost silent for the majority of the time.<br /><br />The touch screen is responsive, the keyboard well laid out and the performance is on par with my desktop machine meaning I can take my gaming and game development with me.","11"

Haven't stressed it yet but so far flawless. Battery life is a tad short but really meant to run on AC. It's so overkill for what I do with it anyway. Mouse Pad not sensitive enough when tapped, have to land on it kinda firmly, don't know if adjustable. May seek a warranty if not, might be a learning curve necessary here.  Otherwise it's wonderful. Screen is great, heavy unit for a laptop. Boots up very quickly! Great keyboard feel but would like brighter key backlights for these old eyes! AND...definitely a fingerprint magnet!   Dislikes now after 8 months.....OK outright hates!!!     1. For the money this should have the option of either side power cord attachment as you really wont use it much without the cord, if ever!!! On the throne maybe? The current left side power cord plug attachment for me is as inconvenient as you can possibly get! Certainly my biggest gripe!!!!     2. Heavy!        3. Mouse pad feel & location. Seems better set up for a southpaw! Same as the damn left side power plug! Would definitely prefer mouse pad a good two inches more to the right, and a different feel to the touch pad surface area, i.e. a slightly grainy surface texture or something!     4. Brighter back-lit keyboard! Big disappointment from what I was hoping for!!! Really frustrating to me in dark areas where I use it most.   5. Dust and fingerprint magnet.   6. DVD drive kicks open way too easily.  Likes: Boot time is awesome! I was going to go up to 16 gig of ram from the 12, and install an SSD but so far totally unnecessary!

I have had this laptop for a week now, and I must say that those worries were unwarranted. The sound volume is actually louder than the Alienware M14x that this replaced. As for the TN display, I was a bit skeptical coming from an IPS display, but have had no issues with that either. The cooling system is more than adequate, and with using a cheap cooling pad, I haven't exceeded 80C. The body is sleek and a very big difference to the alienware body I was used to. I am very happy with this purchase. I haven't noticed any real problems or complaints, with the exception of bloatware(easily remedied) and having to learn to use Windows 8 (easy to figure out). Great Laptop!","0"

The keyboard is one of the best ones I've ever used. Doesn't come filled with much bloatware except Norton.<br /><br />The only major two downsides to this laptop that I've found. If your hands produce any natural oils at all you are going to have a bad time keeping this laptop looking clean. Whatever they coated this laptop with makes it almost impossible to keep clean and smudge free, currently the lid of my laptop is covered in fingerprints from opening and closing it and I have not yet been able to figure out how to clean them off.<br />The second large problem that I've found. The speakers suck. They are absolutely god awful. They sound like that 2 cent speaker you bought in the 1980's. Or like the sound is coming to you through eighteen couches.<br /><br />Minor problems that I've discovered:<br />Touchpad placement, The touchpad is in a terrible place for gamers. Thankfully they give you a button to turn it off so I'm not taking off a star for it.<br />Windows 8.1 is unspeakable garbage. I hate windows 8.1 so, so much. It for a non touchscreen laptop you have no idea how bad it truly is. Currently I have mine modded with a few freeware apps to make it run more like windows 7 and I disabled that god awful pinned apps page.<br />The weight. It's more than you realize. I take my laptop to classes and to coffeeshops to do work occasionally and the laptop just adds so much more to whatever I'm carrying. Buy all of your textbooks online and get rid of any paper materials that you can to make room for this badboy.<br /><br />That sums up my dislikes but don't let them scare you away. This is a fantastic laptop and I love mine and hope it goes for many years.","21"

I have one complaint though, a feature that is driving me a little bonkers. Some genius in design decided to put the SVGA port for a second monitor, along with HDMI and two USB ports, on the right side of the laptop. Right where I keep hitting them with the mouse every couple of minutes, because I have limited desk space here. Why on earth would you design a laptop like that when such a huge percentage of the population is right handed? I predict I will either break a plug, a port, or a combination of these things. Also my mouse is the perfect height to get the left button under the SVGA plug so of course I keep accidentally clicking things I don't mean to.<br />The keyboard is also a little weird but I supposed that's because I'm not used to having a number pad on a laptop.<br />Otherwise, so far so good, hopefully things will stay good other than crazy little design flaws.","1"

Keyboard feels great, this thing stays cool but a cooling mat never hurt anything. Screen has a matte finish, which a lot of people don't seem to touch on so I had to dig a little while researching it, but it's there and looks fantastic. The audio on this thing is easily the best I've heard off of a laptop without plugging external speakers in, especially for gaming, the subwoofer really adds a lot of depth to the audio that most laptops can't by themselves. All of my peripherals run flawlessly, but finding a laptop bag big enough to hold this monstrously large computer is going to take a little digging, but they're out there, especially if you're like me and don't like using backpacks.<br /><br />I'm currently using this thing to run Skyrim on maxed settings running loads of mods, including the awesome HD ones out there and it doesn't skip a beat.","1"

The people are nice, mind you, but they're not competent. I Called for system instability a week after purchase and their best solution was a factory reset, which makes no sense if the computer is basically in factory conditions. I then had a hinge cover pop off, and instead of sending me a new one (it's like a small piece of plastic), they said I have to ship my computer out to have one of their technicians work on it. It's honestly the dumbest thing I've heard--- it's like a button popping off your shirt, so you call the manufacturer and ask them for a new button, and they say &#34;no you need to ship the product out of state for us to replace the button.&#34; I also had issues with system instability that they were unable to address with anything other than a factory reset (only weeks after purchase; basically still in factory conditions). Honestly it seems like they don't know their head from their rear. The initial quality of the product is pretty good, but it's one of those things where you have to cross your fingers and hope you don't have issues that require you to interact with their customer service or technical support. There were other issue that I didn't feel like listing--- just take my word for it. I downgraded the rating to two stars instead of one, because for the price range the solid state drive is still fantastic.","2"

I had read about the issues users were facing with it but still took the gamble and went with it before leaving the States (was only there for a short while). Yea, probably a dumb move seeing as I wouldn't have any chance to RMA it if things did go awry.. However, having said that, I've been using this thing for nearly 6 weeks now, and I have to say, it's great.<br /><br />The unit I recieved from Amazon has a clear bill of health save for the niggling issue of the audio problem (well documented on the ROG site). However, it isn't a deal breaker for me as I use Bluetooth speakers with it most of the time, so I won't knock a star off because of it, although I fully understand why many would find it annoying to the extreme.<br /><br />No doubt If you're reading this review, you already know all the pros of this laptop. My previous machine was a Lenovo Y500 with the GT750m 2GB gddr5 version. Needless to say, in benchmarks, the Asus is on average 2.5X better(!), and the processor in here is about 1.7X faster than the 3632qm in the Lenovo (my reference for the CPU test being a rendering software that is only CPU intensive).<br /><br />My main reason for getting this and not a desktop was because I mainly wanted a gaming rig to compliment my G27 setup at home AND which I could also lug to the office whenever i need the extra horsepower at work. Conclusion: it does all I require it to.<br />The games I mainly play with it are Assetto Corsa, Project Cars and Far Cry 4. Project Cars on max settings with weather effects is the only thing that has shown me the limit of the 970m, and then again, the game isn't finished yet. Expect to see polished frame rates in the final release I suspect.<br />Oh, and just a side note, the GPU overclocks magnificently. Even with numbers I considered fairly ridiculous, the temps never went about 70C. Just remember, you need a slightly older version of the nvidia driver as the latest release (347 or something) for some reason doesn't seem to allow over clocking. No biggie really, as the default performance is more than adequate and the temps are lower too.<br /><br />No buyers remorse here, and I'm based in China :)","2"

Worth the buy.","I just received this laptop today, so take this review with a grain of salt (I will hope to write a follow-up review within a few months).    Amazon:  I have Prime.. it shipped fast and it arrived on a Sunday via USPS which I was surprised about.  So amazon get's a 5 star rating for their service.    Asus:  Specs -  So far the computer is living up to my expectations.  I've installed most of my software and despite being relatively new to Windows 8, everything has been smooth.. and much faster than I'm used to.  I have noticed that the screen is not as bright as my old and much cheaper laptop, but I'm not sure what this means or how important it may be.  I will contribute more to this area with a later review.    Ascetics -  As a student, the ergonomics and functionality of the laptop are great.  The keyboard design allows for easy typing.  The materials which the laptop is made of not only looks great, but keeps clean (much better than my old \\""glossy\\"" laptop).    Con(s) -  1.  The exhaust is on the right side of the laptop, and if you obstruct that side in anyway, you will feel the hot air heating up your left hand on the keyboard.  Being that I expected this, I really don't mind...  I also can't see myself ever really using this laptop on my lap.  2.  The left shift key is getting stuck as I type this review........

I haven’t skimped in resources to have a good product coming from a prestigious company such as Amazon. Everything were good until I started to use it.  The first thing that someone does is to push the power button, well… Nothing happened, first fright from a purchase of 2.000 USD, because normally every notebook comes with a fully battery charge. But then, I raised the computer to check if everything was ok, but, there was a sound, like a loose screw sound, second fright from a purchase of 2.000 USD, I decided to plug-in the power cable, but didnt work.  A friend of mine told me to try turn the computer on by pressing the steam button, it worked, a little relief that didn't last too much because I wanted to close Steam and I intuitively tried to use the touchpad, but it didn't work either, I tried to enable and disable to make it work but it didn’t, I had to use an USB mouse to start using the notebook.  Several disappointments for a brand like ASUS, I think that Amazon sold me a repaired machine and not a new one, for all these problems, I add this weird sound. Several disappointments for a purchase of 2.000USD.  I have fear to keep using this computer because of all these problems, and who knows which others.  Amazon want to compensate with a amount of 100USD, they asked if I could return the product to them, I live in Paraguay, the price for sending from here to USA is about 500 USD, a lot of money which I don’t have right now, I spent all of my money on this computer. I urge Amazon to give me morally correct solutions, not the solutions they are giving me now which makes me lose more money.  Every day without working is money wasted.","16"

For on-the-road use it's adequate.<br /><br />Over time got rid of most of the bloatware that Lenovo loaded into it, especially the Superfish ad-delivery stuff with its serious security flaw.  (note: Lenovo got burned big time with that, has now announced they've stopped preloading crapware entirely)<br /><br />The hybrid drive is interesting concept but its firmware logic needs work.  The idea is that it learns from your using it, puts the frequently used files on the solid-state portion of the unit for superfast access.  Apparently you do NOT want to move files around on your own.  I did, and spent two weeks cursing the frequent half-second game freezes playing World of Warcraft.  Conventional drive defragmenters don't work on hybrid drives.  Solution was brute force, delete all 27 gigs of WoW, move massive photo files onto laptop, then reload game (2.6 hour download).  Seems to have made the drive AI start over, things work okay now.<br /><br />Other annoyance also Warcraft related.  The laptop has Intel chipset graphics and supplements this with an NVidia 860M card for graphics-intensive stuff like gaming.  The resulting frame rate with games is quite good for a laptop, but the combination seems to further complicate problems of keeping games compatible with all the different graphics solutions out there.  Every time I start up Warcraft, I have to alt-ctrl-del to see an error message telling me that a Windows DirectX file is incompatible with Windows.  Click Close and no further problems till next time I start up WoW.  Have reloaded DirectX entirely, have latest drivers for Intel and NVidia, looked all over for fixes, and finally just learned to live with it.  Like the hybrid drive problem, can't really blame Lenovo, just that both of their hybrid solutions need further refining.<br /><br />4 stars as I'm 80% happy with the machine, still looking for a 100% one.","0"

Ran Call of Duty 4 on maxed settings at a steady 91 FPS. Played CSGO on maxed settings with +50 FPS. Only 2 things that I don't like are; trackpad is horrible and you have to launch games from NVIDIA Experience application to run games on Gtx 860m GPU (Coulden't find another way to do so). The Integrated GPU gave me 30 FPS on maxed settings on Call of Duty 4 (which really suprised me for an integrated GPU, must have been the i7 doing the payload). Back to the trackpad... Absolute garbage. But, let me say this. If you buy a gaming notebook, you better use a mouse. It is logic, hence I won't penalize my review for it.<br /><br />I do notice it blowing out a fair ammount of hot air, but that is expected of a gaming notebook. I purchased a laptop cooler to help cool the laptop for a better experience.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Upper-Mid/High gaming notebook, this is for you!

It is incredibly heavy, and despite how much Asus espouses its amazing cooling system, within a week this thing was freezing my system just from playing World of Warcraft. I reinstalled windows, I reinstalled drivers, and finally after buying a cooling fan pad to put underneath it, the freezing stopped. Also, now after less than one year, the charger has busted and needed to be RMA'd. It just started emitting a beeping noise one day and would not charge. This was my first laptop, but I still feel like a charger breaking in less than one year is terrible. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A 2 or 3 YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY ON ANY GAMING LAPTOP. Unless of course you are inherently wealthy, in which case don't worry about it. But if you aren't, it is worth it. A new charger by itself costs $90 +shipping, let alone who knows what else could randomly break. YOU CAN'T BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AFTER 30 DAYS FROM BUYING THE LAPTOP. Don't make the mistake I did. I'm kicking myself, because if something goes wrong after one year, I can't afford a new laptop ~_~","1"

They were charging me something like 15% restock fee.  You gotta be kidding me right?  Well, Amazon did step in and decided to refund the restocking fee.  For what its worth, this is a solid machine other than the screen defect I was experiencing.<br /><br />Since this was my company demo machine (and we need a high end demo machine), I decided to purchase a new one.

Not purely because of aesthetics either.<br /><br />I work in databases and have for over 15 years so I knew what I was looking for when I ordered a new laptop. I wanted power.<br />I am not a gamer, but I do use the CPU and memory for database work and the graphics chip for photography. I use Lightroom with over 200000 images.<br /><br />This, I have hooked up to a 24&#34; dell monitor - and while it isn't QUAD HD like many laptops these days, it is amazing.<br /><br />For me, the fan is pretty quiet, and when I do something intensive it flares up for a while (imagine a dragon breathing fire noise) and then it quietens down again. It's not constant. Just here and there.<br /><br />The laptop has never overheated. I use it on a rubber grip every day, and rarely on my lap.<br /><br />The screen is slightly flimsy and looks like it may break - but it doesn't - it's just lightweight - helps keep the weight down.<br /><br />They keyboard is the one thing that I WOULD change. WHY OH WHY didn't they put the windows key on the left??! Also where is the scroll lock, end, home and insert buttons? NOWHERE standard, that's for sure.<br /><br />But I love it. The smoothness of it - the speed, the ability it has to do anything I've thrown at it. Gamers may have a different experience - but I am a power user, not a gamer.<br /><br />The powerpack isn't too heavy. And in the box there's a laptop sleeve. It's embroidered with the emblem of MSI pretty poorly, but the sleeve itself is nice.<br /><br />Overall, rthis laptop does everything I want - the 3 usb ports, the display output, the gold plated headphone jack, the dual SD/HDD combo, and the thinness.

The keyboard and touchpad are just amazing.<br /><br />Performance: 10/10<br />The specs don't lie on this product<br /><br />Upgradability: 8/10<br />I upgraded to an ssd like everyone else.

Since I use it for content creation, I depend on the color reproduction to not be way off. Sadly, even though this is an IPS display, it has washed out blacks (seriously guys im being picky, if you don't use photoshop every day then you'll be fine). That said, if you're going to be doing graphic work with this then use an external display. I wasted a portfolio print because I trusted this screen. For gaming it is amazing though.<br /><br />Gaming: 10/10<br />I use this to do all my gaming, at home and on the go. It is a true desktop replacement. I have a gaming desktop too but it has an outdated gpu so I just use the laptop and it works fine.<br /><br />While this isn't the fastest laptop on the market, for the price it still rocks.","0"

Not much for me to say other than a mechanical keyboard on a notebook is quite simply an amazing experience.  The screen is beautiful with minimal backlight bleed.  I do say minimal as mine does have a tad at the bottom and bottom.  Nowhere near as severe as the Sager I returned for the GT80 however.  The one highlight of the display is that it can be set to a 90Hz refresh rate.  The GTX 980Ms are a force to be reckoned with.  Absolutely plows through games at max settings.  The machine can get a bit noisy when playing demanding games, but it is tolerable and understandable considering what is being cooled.  The only real caveat I have with the machine is the 2.5&#34; drive is on the SATA II bus.  This is due to the four M.2 slots using up the SATA III.  So, if you plan to ditch the rotating drive for an SSD be aware of the bottleneck.  Overall, this machine is a thing of wonder and if you are willing to heft it around then you will be rewarded with a powerhouse of a notebook.","13"

I picked it up so that I could continue my gaming uninterrupted when travelling for work and staying in hotels. This is the first gaming laptop I have encountered that truly allows me to lose myself in my games the same way I do at home with my desktop. This laptop is simply for gaming. It is barely portable, the battery life is short, and it is very expensive, but for the gamer who wants a truly desktop quality experience in a portable machine, this is a fantastic choice. Gamers interested in this machine are a specific subset of the PC master race. We are exacting and skeptical, but this machine will not disappoint.<br /><br />A few specific notes:<br /><br />As a matter of preference, I am glad that MSI chose to go with a 1080p screen for this machine. It looks good, and it guarantees that settings can be maxed out with max framerates on most games for the next couple of years given the hardware - 4k would have been a stretch. One improvement that would be nice in future models would be an adaptive sync (G-sync) implementation, but that isn't available from any competitor with nVidia graphics in a laptop, so really its just something to dream of in the future at this point.<br /><br />I originally had doubts about the wisdom of getting the 001 model vs the 009, think that I may be disappointed with the CPU performance, however, I can report that it has not been an issue whatsoever. The notoriously CPU-hungry BF4 performs flawlessly on Ultra with max framerate even on 64p conquest servers.<br /><br />Finally, the keyboard feels wonderful! This was one of the most attractive features of the machine. Ordering this computer online, I worried that the mechanical keyboard in a laptop may feel cramped or gimmicky, but it is stellar. I like it at least as well at the Corsair Vengeance K95 I use on my desktop (sometimes I think I may even like it better), and it keeps me from having to lug a keyboard around when I take a long trip andwant to get in some lengthy gaming sessions away from home.<br /><br />In closing, this machine is the real deal. If you need portability and you want a truly desktop-class gaming experience, you will not go wrong with this monster of a computer.","12"

Case is much slimmer than I thought, coming from an Asus G55.  Fan noise can get loud due to the dual fans cooling the GPU, but that's a decent trade-off for keeping everything cool in such a slim case.  Has room for two 7 mm hard drives, I added a second SSD to mine for more storage space.  The 8gb RAM is enough for now, but it's nice knowing I can expand it up to 32 when needed eventually.  I usually go through a laptop every two years, but I look forward to keeping this for long past that.  Clevo puts out solid barebones kits, and Eluktronics has placed minimal branding on it.  It looks more like a Thinkpad than a gaming laptop, The metal chassis feels extremely solid and thus far has remained cool even while gaming.  The fans are louder than my old G55, but the gtx 970m is in an entirely different class than the gtx 660m.  It can definitely handle games without any problems though. So far I've played Crysis 3, Skyrim, the Witcher 2, Final Fantasy XIV, and Mass Effect 3 on it at max settings without any slowdowns.  Usually averaging between 60-70 fps without tinkering with drivers, though the GTX 970m can be overclocked.  Overall I would highly recommend this laptop and Eluktronics.  Eluktronics has extremely fast shipping, and their price is extremely competitive with other models built on the Clevo P650SE chassis.  This laptop is an even better deal with an SSD and Windows already pre-installed.","12"

I DID come across the &#34;awful sound&#34; issue, but this was easily fixed by downloading an updated driver. Now it sounds wonderful. People need to do a little research before posting awful reviews. The screen quality is amazing, dispite what people say. Obviously if you poke at it it's going to cause distortion. Thats just the type of screen it is. The same thing happens on your android or iphone if you push hard enough. The colors are very vivid, and sometimes seems to have an orange hue, like a glow. But it makes everything seem very bright. I don't think this is a bad quality. The ROG interface has a few screen options as well as a manual one if you want to change this.  Onto my actual review! The laptop itself feels very sturdy and well built. It definitely has some weight to it, but still fits comfortably in your lap. The touchpad is very nice, and the keys have the right amount of give to them. It is made out of a very smooth rubbery plastic material that feels soft to the touch. Then ofcourse you have the brushed metal portion. The rear red vents actually have a glittery shimmer to them, just a heads up to the guys out there. As for how it runs, it is very quiet even while gaming. This is definitely a powerful laptop. I will update after some time has gone by","13"

Customer service was above reproach; I called and they were knowledgable and friendly and local (from a global perspective.) I couldn't recommend the company any more positively.<br /><br />I've had a clevo platform laptop before and I loved it and this continues the trend. This is based off the 650se, a move to make them slimmer while retaining some respectable power. They succeeded on both fronts. This is remarkably thinner and lighter than my 2013 MSi GX60, and with the white backlit keys and understated finishes it looks sleek and very business-like. The hinges have a little flex but no worrisome wobble, and the screen is as sturdy as you would expect it to be in a thin(ner) form laptop. It has flex if you force it, but why would you? The only downside is that the motherboard and GPU are soldered. There's no room for any other option in this thin platform, so don't plan on upgrading them.<br /><br />I ordered mine with the FHD screen, 16gb of ram and a 256gb SSD. I'll add another hard drive later, but that's not relevant. I wanted enough hdd space to get up and running with a few games while I shop for a good deal on a much larger SSD. There's plenty of expansion room with 2x M2 slots and another 7mm slot. There are also 4x total slots for ram, 2 under the keyboard and 2 under the access panel. To my understanding the two under the keyboard will both be utilized with your RAM selection, ie 8gb = 2x 4gb sticks, because who wants to pull their keyboard?<br /><br />Speaking of keybaords, this one has a good feel for typing, a mellow backlight, and the wasd keys have red arrows on them. No complaints. I also liked the physical seperation of the left and right trackpad keys, it gives you a satisfying click. I use a wired external mouse anyways, but when I take it with me for work I like to have a usable trackpad. Windows 8 gestures didn't always register.<br /><br />Speakers sound good for what they are, they seemed balanced at higher volumes. The inclusion of the soundblaster software was a nice touch and gives the audio a bit more substance than it may have with hardware alone.<br /><br />Actual performance is easier to review online. The GTX970 is well regarded with a huge increase over the 8xx series in every way, up to 50% in some cases. The i74720HQ multi-tasks with ease and didn't leave me wishing I had more. I run on a stock clock until I feel the need to do otherwise and I think I'll be fine for quite some time here.<br /><br />Games I've played on Ultra with no hiccups: Heart of the swarm, witcher 2, skyrim, WoW, etc. I don't play a lot of the newer games that are more demanding, but reviews on the video card at a 1080p resolution seem to indicate that there should be no problem playing anything at all. I am enamored with this little piece of hardware.<br /><br />If you have questions, feel free to ask. I'm sure I forgot something someone would love to know.","11"

Specs that rival my mid-range desktop even. This has only solidified my opinion that MSI is the best brand for power in portable devices.  Few things I especially like about it: -The button that turns the fans on turbo is really nice, gives me control and lets me keep the computer cooler when it should be -While strictly a cosmetic novelty, the rainbow backlight on the keyboard is really cool -It's a very powerful laptop, for example I manage 60fps on Crysis 2 on its Extreme setting with vsync on -It's big and weighty, which I value in a laptop meant to be powerful  Few things that aren't so good: -It comes with Windows 8.1 -The trackpad has the mouse buttons built into it instead of separate (why is this a trend?), which is terribly uncomfortable and makes a separate mouse basically mandatory -The trackpad is also textured, has some grain going vertically so when moving your finger up and down it feels smooth, but rough going side-to-side. I don't know why they texture it at all, it's incredibly uncomfortable and makes the fingers sore quickly. There's really nothing good about this trackpad, buy a mouse with this laptop, or maybe at least some high-grit sandpaper to smooth out the trackpad -The disk drive feels particularly flimsy -It comes with Norton Internet Security pre-installed which was the very first thing I uninstalled when the overlong system setup was finished -Seriously, Windows 8's interface in every way is such a massive step down from 7  Other Notes: -The hard drive is separated into two partitions for some reason. That's not a bad thing, just weird. I managed to work it into my organization system pretty well -When gaming it regularly runs quite hot, even regardless of how intensive the game is, temperature (C) hitting upper 70s to low 80s whether I'm running something crazy like Crysis 2 or the simple pixel-art game Faster Than Light.  -The processor is advertised at 3.6 GHz but it only boosts to that under certain conditions. That's again not a bad thing, just slightly confusing. You'll still get the full 3.6 GHz whenever you need it, especially since it's a quad core with hyperthreading so you have 8 effective logical cores, there's definitely no shortage at all of processing power  PSA: For something this expensive, only order this from the Amazon direct seller, none of those other weirder resellers. Only go with Sold & Shipped by Amazon, anywhere else could very easily be counterfeits or defective products. That's actually probably where all those 1-star reviews complaining of defects off to the side came from.","52"
"B00TI6TAJ4","MSI GP Series GP60 Leopard Pro-825 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop Black","5","2015-05-26","Probably one of the best buys for the value.","Pros: For under a $1000 this is probably one of the best laptops, specification wise out there. It will be able to do most gaming on high to Ultra settings without absolutely bogging down gameplay with lag. The computer has pretty good sound, though i rarely use mine without headphones in. I was looking to upgrade from a really old and crappy toshiba, that had trouble running games on minimum specs. I did about 5 days worth of research, and for the price this was the best out there that fit what i was looking for.<br /><br />Cons: It is a little heavier than most laptops, which doesn't bother me, but if your planning on doing a lot of traveling with it, just keep that in mind. The fan runs a little loud, but it does keep the laptop to only reasonably warm. The biggest con i found, was that the built in microphone. The microphone on the laptop seems has trouble hearing my voice at a normal talking level at more than a couple feet away and picks up a lot of background noise from typing and clicking. It's not a big deal, and doesn't make things too hard, and using a plug in mic should fix that.","13"

Got this to replace both my 5-year old gaming desktop and middle range laptop.  However I had 2 big issues with this which lost a star for me:<br /><br />1. The ROG GameFirst III software caused me to get random 1-second lag spikes in games while using a wireless connection.  Disabling it fixed the issue, but I had no idea what was wrong until I read another review on here with the same problem and fix.<br /><br />2. Both the SSD and hard drive are divided into 2 parts, for a total of 4 partitions on this laptop.  I'm not sure what the motivation for this is (especially on the hard drive - at least on the SSD there's a partition which is designated for the OS).<br /><br />Some smaller pros and cons:<br />+Not flashy - the matte black design is low key which I liked compared to other laptops<br />+Decent battery life (about 60 minutes gaming, 160 while not), but you definitely want to be plugged in while gaming<br />+Blazing fast startup - about 7-10 seconds to have the desktop loaded<br />+Great gaming performance, and doesn't heat up<br />-Keyboard has special buttons for Steam, nVidia's Shadowplay recording feature, and launching the ASUS gaming center - I don't like having keyboard buttons for specific programs<br />-The power charger doesn't clamp into the laptop well and is prone to fall out if you're moving around<br />-By default headphone virtualization and a &#34;multimedia&#34; sound filter are enabled, which change what all audio sounds like.

I own 2 big gaming laptops and the SF-19 does a better job cooling than pretty much anything.  I have tried a lot of coolers  The problem is these things fall apart after 4-6 months of light to moderate use.  I have owned 2 USB 3.0 models and 2 USB 2.0 models.  ALL of the hubs have stopped working after only a few months.  The LED lights on ALL of these went out under 6-8 months of use.  The fans are pretty reliable, and while they become a bit more noisy with age, they do keep on running.  The last huge problem with these is the crappy power connector.  My first 2 units have completely shorted out and 1 of the others is really glitchy.  I have to put pressure on it for the fans to spin up.  I can understand normal wear and tear but my laptops sit stationary pretty much 99.9% of the time.  The connectors are very weak.  I contacted support regarding warranty service but you have to pay for shipping and this thing is big.  You're looking at paying $20+ shipping to RMA this thing.  I'm really mixed on this.  I hope CM improves the reliability on the successor to this.  It is the best as far as laptop cooling goes but unfortunately, the reliability is terrible.","1"

I find that a good cue that your laptop needs to take a break since those temperatures are detrimental to its longevity.<br />-Elsewhere, the internal temperature is pretty low, around 35-45 degrees Celsius for regular use, and 50-80 degrees for gaming. Needless to say your lap won't get burned.<br />-Blazing-fast boot speeds. Once you go SDD, you will never go back to HDD (except maybe for idle backup storage).<br />-Handy  backlit keyboard with 2 light intensity modes so<br />-minimalistic, slim, and jet-black design that doesn't scream &#34;expensive gaming laptop waiting to be stolen.&#34; I could use this in meetings without looking gaudy.<br />-affordable and upgradeable--NO TAXES!<br />-Windows software without a litany of useless stock apps.<br />-970M, the second best GPU chip as of this review, runs solidly. However, with more graphic intensive games being released, I don't think it's future-proofed for more than 3 years since I already find myself lowering graphics from ultra to very high. Consider investing in the 980M if you're an ultra-high-end mobile gamer, but for most this will do.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-dual fans can become rather noisy when gaming heavily and with turbo boost, but in a slim case with a 970M GPU this is a necessary tradeoff. Just use headphones.<br />-nothing stellar about the speakers compared to other gaming laptops with subwoofers and 5.1 surround sound. Pretty decend and loud enough to reverberate a large living room. Again, a necessary tradeoff for a slim profile.<br />-metallic case is a fingerprint magnet if you have greasy hands. Will have to wipe it regularly, which I guess is a good habit...<br />-battery life isunder 3.5 hours normal use, less than 2 for gaming. Not a Macbook air, so keep the charger around.<br /><br />Overall, this gaming laptop is a humble beast, and I'd prefer this over the ASUS ROG with the 970M chip. Look no further for a better price-to-performance deal!","15"

For the first week they were great, after that. It's been nothing but problems. So let's start with the bad: -I had random overheating and crashing -Drivers crashing every other day and have taken a lot of fixing -My husband's crashed and BSOD from a OS corruption and he lost all his files -Mine has had numerous heating issues and occasional crashes, drivers corrupted and you name it we've had it.  Mind you, we've had these for 2 MONTHS! I wish I could still return them or send them back for replacements but sadly I can't be without a computer for that long. I use this for school and travel for work and wanted to have something I could also play games on.  Now the good:  It's very powerful, it runs mostly all the new top end stuff very smoothly, super beastly processor Great graphics card. All around, great laptop. If you happen to get one without all the problems, it should suit your gaming needs, however if you end up like us....then return it while you still have time","4"

No doubt it is a great deal with this price, $899. Coming from a 5 year old desktop that I built myself, this is more than twice as fast. I am a Ph.D. student that run codes and simulations from time to time, so this laptop proves to be quite useful, my simulations take half the time to run. For this price I did not expect a SSD, but once I put one in, it performs like a charm. 15.6 inches seems quite big when almost every other laptops are 13.3. But it is necessary to accommodate the hardware. I also quite like the looks of the computer.<br />So why only 3 stars? I am going to list some of the pros and cons.<br />Pros: Core i7-4720HQ quad core, 8GB memory, 1 TB hard drive, very powerful GTX 960M w/ 4GB ram (for a laptop). A/C WiFi, Bluetooth, 1920x1080 IPS, backlit keyboard.<br />Cons: Well, only 1 con, a pretty annoying one. I think to save cost and make the laptop easier to make, Acer decided to put all the port on one side. Which personally I dont mind. However, the EM interference is pretty significant when you have all the ports that close together. As a result, the headphone jack make my speakers buzz like crazy whenever the laptop is at sleep or off, I suspect it is due to the other connections and electronics in close proximity. This loud buzzing disappears when both the power cord and the HDMI cable are unplugged, or when the laptop is on. So, Acer in saving cost, also saved the validation needed on this product.<br />But ultimately, I do not plan on returning the laptop unless something else breaks. I do not think that a laptop with this kind of performance and this price is easy to find.","42"

It worked well enough to not send it back, right up until after the warranty ran out. However the track pad issue others have reported was ever-present. It's not just if you have the power plugged in - the mouse cursor will jump around and randomly click things if you have something plugged into any USB port or the HDMI port as well. Huge pain. Recently took it in to be serviced and were told by the techs that they almost never work on Republic Of Gamer laptop due to their design: it's easy to break custom pieces just by taking this thing apart. They made an exception, but the quote of the day was &#34;built with an expiration date.&#34;<br /><br />It ran things alright, but it was not the monster others have professed. I never felt it lived up to its specs. It routinely choked on large Photoshop ans Illustrator files, had trouble running Star Citizen smoothly, and the HDMI output was touchy at best.<br /><br />Cannot possibly recommend this thing.

The laptop runs great, fairly cool. The rear fan design is awesome. Keeps the laptop pretty cool. It does heat up when gaming for a while of course, but it's not too loud. I use headphones mostly anyway so the fan doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Four stars because my first G751JY-DH71, had to be returned due to the backlight bleed on black screens. This was very distracting on diablo3, and just annoying. Amazon sent a new one quickly so no problem there.<br /><br />The new laptop has a slightly sticky Enter key that clicks louder than other keys. It's almost like an edge binds up a bit at times. It's a little annoying but I'm not going to send another one back just for that issue.<br /><br />I highly recommend you update all available drivers when you get this. I used the laptop on my wireless AC router, and had some pretty high latency. I went to intel, grabbed the latest wireless drivers and that dialed out the issue for me. Another poster here said speakers had a driver issue too, but I didn't update that driver since I've been using headphones.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of nagware you need to uninstall, but it's not overly annoying.  When playing Heroes of the Storm, I kept accidentally pressing the windows key and exiting to desktop instead of hitting the Z key to mount up. This was fairly annoying so I downloaded auto hot key, and wrote a script to disable the windows key http://www.autohotkey.com/ The Z and Windows key are right next to each other to I recommend disabling it for important gaming sessions. Part of hitting it likely was due to me getting accustomed to using the keyboard.<br /><br />I also ordered the matching backpack to store/carry the laptop. I highly recommend that as well. Definitely well made and beefy. I like the laptop, and I definitely would recommend it to people, but just to make sure you check it out quality-wise before you install everything on it.","1"

"B00JXLGE7K","Alienware ALW17-5312sLV 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop [Discontinued By Manufacturer]","4","2015-06-22","My Dream Machine","This system is everything I hoped for in a laptop intended for primary use as a gaming system (mostly Second Life). Seller quickly resolved any issues I had with delivery and has been very helpful with some technical issues. I'd happily give 4.8 stars, if I could (short of a 5 from minor irritations). I've had the unit about 2 weeks. Here's my review, so far. If I come up with other items, I'll edit/add to the review.<br /><br />Pros -<br />It's handled nearly everything I've thrown at it: running multiple programs simultaneously, with no discernible loss in performance or overheating.<br />Screen is crystal clear and graphics are crisp and lively.<br />The fact that it came with Win7 was a *huge* plus for me.<br />As a result of preinstalled &#34;Killer Network Manager&#34; I'm actually getting a boost in wifi signal. Major cudos on that one.<br />I like the extended keyboard platform where I rest my wrists. I'm not a mouse user, so being able to rest my hands on the platform works well for me. I like the touch/feel of the keys (quiet - no clackity clacks - with a satisfying depth/response of individual keystrokes; the placement of function keys and separate arrow keys took a bit of getting used to).<br />I don't use the fancy lighting effects, but they're nice to have available if I do want them (wish it was easier to make custom colors .. but .. meh .. mostly I don't care), but others seem to drool over them.<br />The base surface feels like a matte-finished rubberized texture. Still have to find out the best method for cleaning it, but I find that it's not nearly as hot to rest my hands on, compared with units that use a metallic/shiny surface (designed to help wick away heat in the less expensive systems I've previously owned).<br />System restarts are lightning fast.<br />It has much better sound than most laptops, but I'm NOT an audiophile, so am not the best judge of such things<br /><br />Caveats .. this was a factory refurbished system and came with a stripped down version of most drivers and the HDD hadn't been prepped or partitioned, so that took a bit of setup and is NOT for the novice user or faint-of-heart. Not a complaint, just an observation.<br /><br />Cons - (mostly irritants .. not really defects or fails)<br />As has been noted by others, this is NOT a lightweight notebook ... it's hefty.<br />Battery time while gaming is no better than 2 hours (closer to 1 - 1.5 hrs), with only a slight improvement while performing other tasks, up to 2.5 hours. It's not easily replaceable, so having a charged backup isn't really an option. And recharging takes HOURS. So this really isn't your on-the-go option. Better to think of it as a low profile desktop system, with some portability. Frankly, I'm accustomed to having a wimpy battery, so doesn't come as much of a surprise or disappointment.<br />The power cord/adapter is a monster and needs about 1.5&#34; clearance (on the left side of the unit) and probably adds another pound to the carry weight.<br />Did NOT come with the trial MS Office software, but I use Open Office, so didn't really care.","1"

The ram is way more than is needed for average consumers who are going to browse the web with this laptop. There are a lot of pros and cons to this laptop and there will be a more descriptive review below this. MSI does an amazing job as always on their laptops. Its no doubt that so much pros use their brand. I love the sleek design of this laptop and the audio boost that comes with this is amazing. Don't expect much bass from these speakers unless your plan buy external ones like me. From the testing I've done so far on minecraft it runs amazing with 90-100 fps on high settings. Although I do not plan on gaming much with this laptop I do plan to do a lot of youtube videos. This laptop has no problem with cooling. The fans do make some noise but not a lot compared to my desk top. The graphics within this computer is enough to run games like GTA or COD on low to med settings. Don't expect to much from it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Amazing for its price<br />Sleek Design<br />Amazing Display<br />Comes with 1 year warranty<br />Fan noise is not as much as desktops<br /><br />Cons:<br />No backlights on keyboard<br />Can't handle games on ultra high settings<br />A lot of pre-installed bloat ware<br /><br />Get this laptop if you want a gaming laptop that you are going to play minecraft with. Don't get this laptop if you plan to play todays games on ultra high settings. For its price this laptop is a definite win.","3"

It's solid and it doesn't flex when you're typing.<br />One of the things that I would consider a con is that the computer gets very hot. I'm sure you're heard this in other reviews too. I play some games on here such as Cities: Skylines and TF2 and a few more, and it usually reaches it's peak around 87-88 degrees Celcius. This causes the very left side of the keyboard to be hot to the touch. I am considering buying a cooling pad for this machine to fix this issue.<br />The last con I've found was that it picks up fingerprints very easily. I am a neat-freak so I like to keep things clean. I usually wipe it down with some windex about once a week. That helps it stay looking nice and new.","3"

"B00TI6TAWG","MSI GP Series GP70 Leopard Pro-486 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop (Black)","5","2015-07-09","Beast machine for a lamb's price.","The advertised 3.6ghz is not entirely accurate.  It can be overclocked to 3.6ghz, but out the box it sits at 2.6ghz.  Not a real big difference there for those who are just going to use the machine for everyday use or a few random, low power games.  I did have an issue with the camera not working to begin with, BUT, it's a simple fix by just &#34;turning the camera on&#34;.... (Simplest solutions first, people).<br /><br />First step should be to uninstall and get rid of all the bloatware and added on apps that are just garbage and won't ever be used.  Free up disk space and processes to make the machine run even smoother than what it originally does out the box.<br /><br />The Nvidia GeForce App doesn't read all games on the market right now, even with updates.  Especially not newer titles like Witcher 3, or WWE2k15 or GTA V.  (The GTX950M can more than handle these games beautifully, you will just have to optimize them manually instead of using the Nvidia tool to do so.)<br /><br />Only thing that I didn't like about it was that the hard drive was already pre-partitioned, but that was remedied within the first day of use.  Just a minor inconvenience and nothing that would make me say not to buy this computer.<br /><br />I agree with others that the computer does get a tad bit on the warm side with prolonged gaming or with games that are process and graphics heavy, but it's not so hot that I feel it would fry anything in the long term.<br /><br />After about a month of daily use and heavy strain to test this laptop's limits, I definitely recommend it for those who want the portability of a laptop with the power of a lowend gaming PC.<br /><br />My next test will involve streaming and video capture with the device while gaming, and I will update my review once I have completed those tests.  But for now, this thing is on point and certainly worth a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Please disregard the 1 star review from the customer complaining about Chrome and Firefox notworking.  That's not the case with the laptop, and what their issue more than likely was, was a malware issue caused by the user.","17"

With so many to choose from and so many reviews to go through it becomes a headache to decide what is best for you. I started with searching the internet for the best laptop coolers, and although it helped I still couldn't decide. Once I gave it more thought as to what's best for me I found this Thermaltake Massive SP. I needed something thin, not power hungry, usb capable, and could cool a 17&#34; gaming laptop for an affordable price. This bad boy has it all, and the fact it comes with a very very good set of general use speakers was the deciding factor! That gave me one thing less to carry with me on trips.  I've been very impressed with this cooler/speaker combo. I have very little experience with laptops and coolers. I do have a lot of experience with building gaming PCs. Cooling is a very important factor for proformance! As well as longevity. My time before review for this cooler is short, but after using the laptop alone without a cooler, and then switching to using one for the past few days I've discovered the proformance of this 140mm fan to be up to the task of cooling my laptop by about 5 degrees on average during full load. The speakers are amazing and fill the room up with lots of deep base. I usually have to keep my laptops volume around 70-100%, but now I keep it around 20-40%. Fun fact, I booted up my PC after plugging these in for the first time and my eyeballs nearly poped out of my head. They are loud. I can't wait to try them out on my next trip.","1"

First and foremost this machine is for work. Its the thinnest quad core with dedicated graphics, with a premium build, and a decent battery. I work in a field ruled by Macs and I commute and travel a fair bit and I can't be lugging around a 7lb piece of cheap glued plastic with a 36 minute battery life. It ticks all of the boxes for me and ultimately I feel I got what I paid for. If it holds up I'll surely be back for another.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Runs latest Ubuntu fairly well (only bug is you need to click &quot;Sleep&quot; before closing lid...)<br />Fully maxed out, it gives many desktops a run for their money.<br />Never slows down, never hiccups.<br />Battery is decent once tweaked.<br />Looks good besides the Razer logo on the back - if your over 30 you'll want to cover it up :P<br />Screen is the best I've had on a PC.<br />Silent when running Ubuntu unless I'm compiling something for more than a few minutes straight.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Loud under medium load and any time I run Windows 8. You NEED headphones while gaming.<br />A lot of bezel around screen. Its more than I expected, but not a deal breaker.<br />Speakers are so so.<br />Only has HDMI 1.4a with no other display connectors.<br />Minimal look is huge plus, but I could go for mini display port and maybe an sd card slot.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Still running strong. Recently got a 4k monitor and found my first real complaint - it only has HDMI 1.4a which means 4k is stuck at a choppy 30Hz. Even dragging the mouse across the screen looks ridiculous let alone anything else with movement. I'll keep poking at it to see what if it can be remedied.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:<br /><br />After ~6 months the delete key and right arrow keys started to go. They'd repeat several times from a single press, and now finally died entirely. Working with Razer to resolve. Stuff like this shouldn't happen on a nearly $3,000 laptop.","4"

Games run on high usually, sometimes medium. GTA V runs smoothly, load times are bearable. But I've had some headaches getting it to work as advertised. NVidia software was not on the computer, so the video card did not work at all until I fixed that issue. Boot time out of the box was painfully slow, so I looked into the issue. The 128GB ssd was nowhere to be found. According to ASUS tech support, Windows should be installed on the ssd to allow faster boot times. It most certainly is not. It doesn't even get recognized by the BIOS, and appears and disappears out of device manager. I'm working to get this issue sorted out, but this computer definitely did not come out of the box as advertised. Buyer beware!<br /><br />That being said, after the long boot time, games run well.

I got it new and went to boot it up to do all the setup, and it's been the slowest laptop I've ever had. I don't have anything on it at all that would cause it to boot and run as slowly as it does. It even pushed me to the point to purchase a SSD just to speed up everything. Besides that, it's a good Lenovo laptop. I'd DEFINITELY say to upgrade it to Windows 10 as soon as you get it because Windows 8 is literally worse than Vista IMHO.

It has been a roller coaster but I love this machine now that I've got it working (see below ISSUES and RESOLUTIONS)<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am coming off a 2014 Retina MacBook Pro from work w/16GB RAM 500GB SSD NVIDIA 8something discrete graphics.<br />Disclaimer 2: some of this info is reposted from other answers here (though I verified going thru it myself) I just wanted to include them to provide condensed fixes and review.<br /><br />That said I really love this laptop. playing FNV heavily modded on full graphics settings (as well as some other stuff). Does well @1080p 60hz internally and over HDMI too, haven't tried displayport. It's not the most graphics intensive game but I've added plenty of extra physics and TONS of NPCs via mods.<br />THE THING STAYS COOL!!! Left fur mark on and fell asleep and it was cool as could be and completely responsive in the AM. Temps were low as well on internal sensors.<br />Screen is good (obviously cannot compete with retina), has decent brightness, and good contrast, and pretty good viewing angles. The retina used to make my eyes hurt, but asus includes a neat little utility for &#34;eye care&#34; mode which is actually kinda cool (silly I know, but I like it). Sound is good, fills a medium size room with little issue (also improvement over the MBP). Note also that with the newer nvidia card and 1080p resolution games run much better than in say bootcamp on the similar spec'd retina which got choppy after too many mods. Very smooth for most games on high or ultra, I've read crysis and a few other really high end physics games will drop to 40 fps, but I don't play them :p<br /><br />Biggest complaint is the trackpad, but I hate most PC trackpads and usually use a mouse so this wasn't an issue. Could probably be fixed with sensitivity tweaking but I don't care that much.<br /><br />Battery is reasonable to excellent especially if you're comfortable getting into your power management advanced settings. Even gaming @ 75-90% brightness with nvidia card used exclusively I get 2-3 hrs<br /><br />Note the SSD is a &#34;half card ssd&#34; card so until a capacity comes out larger than the Kingston it comes with, it will NOT be upgrade-able, and even when that does happen it will void your warranty (though if you don't mind opening up the non user serviceable area I gather it isn't hard). It's also not the fastest ssd in the tool shed (write speeds with mixed r/w are kinda low) but it gets the job done and is still far far from HDD land (8-10 second boot to login). Of course you could always replace the HDD with a 3.5&#34; sata ssd of your choice, that was my plan anyway.<br /><br />Note there is no recovery media, so backup before tinkering! You can reinstall with any Win8 media or download it from MS since your license key is in the BIOS<br /><br />ISSUES and RESOLUTIONS<br /><br />Ok so I'm mainly writing this review to share my experience with the &#34;bios loop&#34; or &#34;dead ssd&#34; and the &#34;driver_state_power_failure&#34; issues reported here, and an HDMI audio out issue I had (and their resolutions)<br /><br />It's possible others have really had bad drives but my experience the &#34;bad ssd&#34; or &#34;bios loop&#34; was fixable by reinstalling or disabling secure boot. There are other ways to fix it but you'll need to be comfortable with secure boot and offline bcd editing.<br /> if you can no longer see the Kingston ssd as a startup option in the boot menu first disable secure boot<br />(press esc on startup) security &#62; secure boot menu &#62; secure boot control &#62; select disabled THEN<br />save changes and exit and go back into bios &#62; boot and set launch csm to enabled<br />If you don't see the ssd right away reboot and go back into bios and see if it is there.<br />If it's not, you may need to return it but try updating bios to the newest through the EZ FLASH utility WITHIN BIOS, DONT USE WINFLASH<br /><br />On to HDMI audio out: was getting perfect picture but no audio, saying the cable was disconnected. Uninstalled the intel hd graphics 4600 drivers (noted that my drivers were newer than those on the asus site) AND HD Audio drivers AND Realtek audio drivers. Make sure to check the &#34;delete driver software&#34; box when prompted. Don't restart. Then install the Intel VGA driver from the asus site for this model voila. Reinstall Realtek audio drivers.<br /><br />On to driver_state_power_failure BSOD issue: was getting unpredictable blue screens after the first few days. Reinstalled and issue persisted.<br />DO NOT USE NVIDIA DRIVERS FROM SITE or allow GeForce experience to keep you &#34;updated&#34;. My resolution was to reinstall the nvidia driver from the asus site (Version  V9.18.13.4505) and be sure to perform a clean install. Also note that the second time around I left all of the 3d settings at default, but I'm relatively certain it's the driver version. I will update if I learn more. @1 week no issues w/heavy use.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic set of hardware for the price (with a bit of troubleshooting) if you're looking for a budget gaming laptop and are tied to 15&#34;, otherwise go with the 17&#34; for the better graphics card if you care.<br /><br />Hope this helps, will report back if any fixes end up not working.","4"
"B00KD5DUR2","Lenovo Y50 Performance Gaming Laptop - DOORBUSTER","5","2015-08-08","fantastic fantastic fantastic","So I've had this laptop for a month! It's the best laptop I've ever had!<br /><br />I got it from a third party vendor, so the specifications are a bit different:<br /> Lenovo Y50 Laptop Computer - 59421855 - Black - 4th Generation Intel Core i7-4710HQ / 16GB RAM / 15.6&#34; FHD 1920x1080 Display / NVidia GeForce 860M 4GB [ASIN: B00KD5DUR2]<br /><br />The processing power is amazing; every game and program I've run does so amazingly. I recently updated to Windows 10 and hit no snags at all. When I first got the product, there was an issue of the screen flickering, especially when I was not playing a game but had the laptop on charge, but by fiddling with my driver settings everything became fine. The sound is amazing. Only someone raised in a gold-plated cradle would complain about the screen quality. The backlit keyboard is nice. The computer itself is beautiful - almost too beautiful in the way it stands out in the crowd. Start-up time is amazingly fast; the whole experience is just so seamless now.<br /><br />The trackpad, though, is terrible. My old laptop was a cheap low budget HP Compaq Presario and even when I first began using it, manipulating the mouse was an easy and nimble affair (though maybe a little loud). In comparison, this laptop that at full price would have cost me nearly six times as much as my Presario feels almost impossible to use on a daily basis without a mouse. That's not really a reason not to buy the laptop; it's a reason to get a mouse, which always works better than a trackpad. If you want to use the trackpad occasionally, like when you're just lounging around, that's okay; it's not impossible. But it's just so much more frustrating than with my old laptop that I'm just not going to say anything positive about it.<br /><br />Getting this laptop, though, has felt like a dream. There's so very little I want in a laptop that this device doesn't have. As a kid, I didn't think I'd be able to enjoy owning something that worked this well untilmuch later in my life. But here it is!","0"

So, a bit salty. I will update the review once I have the money to return the system. It was great while it worked, it actually surpassed expectations. You see people saying &#34;WOW, you can /actually/ game on it!&#34;, and you can. It also works very well with Maya, 3dsMax, Unity, and Unreal. It had issues installing the Oculus Runtime, and utilizing the Oculus DKII as a display, but after much trial and error, it worked. But alas, it has fallen to the deadly &#34;Idling-on-Desktop&#34;. edit: I was able to RMA it and got it back working. I removed one of the stickers, and took a picture of the serial to see if they'd repair the system or send me a refurbished computer (as some laptop manufacturers have done to me in the past). They replaced the boot drive with a (presumably) refurbished M.2 SSD, which works perfectly fine. The RMA process took approx. two weeks, during which I was in school for CAD/3D modeling and design, and was left to pay the shipping myself. Satisfied with the system (now that it's working), customer service could have been better.","3"

I bought this one after 2 weeks of research and drooling over the GT80 Titan SLI-263 (which I would probably give a kidney and various other things for it is that impressive.)  Since selling body parts isn't legal I had to settle for this.  If I were able to I would have saved for a better laptop, but I only need it for school and light gaming.  MSI did a great job with the cooling in this system with nothing running the GPU is sitting at around 32-40c and the processor is around 38-47c. the lower temperatures are with the fan boost on, highest without.  While I can't play inquisition with all the settings on ultra it still plays it pretty well.  Most of the benchmark tests I have seen were decent for this laptop, and seem to be correct (I have watched every review I could find for this laptop and none of them seem to differ.)  Out of the 900 series of GPU's this one is Fairly decent for the price, stays fairly cool, and low power usage.  I love the steelseries engine it is a great addition to this laptop.  True color display is also very nice If you get headaches from staring at the white microsoft office screen for too long you could set it on anti blue and you will be fine for a while.  I Have not had this laptop for too long so I do not know about the battery life I haven't had the need to unplug it yet but it seems MSI has put a limit on the battery charge so it isn't sitting at full charge while plugged in.  I am buying this laptop after my ASUS died and I have to tell you if nothing goes wrong with this laptop I believe I have a new favorite product.  My previous laptop weighed 10lbs and could not stay cool even after I reapplied the thermal paste to CPU and GPU.  The weight of this laptop feels ok It will fit into a backpack easily and take up very little space.  It is light enough to be portable and decent enough to play games I like it well enough.  If you are on a budget and looking for a decent laptop that you can play video games and more with this is a good choice.  I would recommend this laptop to someone on a budget but if you like cranking up settings in games and you can afford to pay the extra $300-400 do it.  From what I understand the 970m is a pretty big leap forward from the 960m.  I would have waited and saved to buy better but I needed the laptop for school and I needed it quickly.  Pros: I love the weight 5lbs isn't too bad Steelseries engine Responsive keyboard Useful programs provided from MSI Thin Can be upgraded to include 3 M.2 SSDs Great cooling Fan boost Price to hardware  Cons: Usual windows cleanup needed Some MSI software to clean up  Other than that I don't have anything else    Update tried overclocking the gpu.  I overclocked the gpu but there really wasn't any difference I went from 24 fps in dragon age Inquisition to 28 FPS on high to ultra settings.  Ran a stress test and found that the gpu will not get over 72c starts throttling hard at 6 min on furmark stress test started seeing major artifacts.so since this does not seem worthwhile I will be resetting everything back to original settings and just enjoy what I have.  I still like the laptop though.","14"

I read many many reviews before purchasing this laptop and I went for it. Some certain amazon reviewers posted helpful tips and evaluation of the product itself and it greatly helped reach my conclusion.<br /><br />So when I first received my laptop everything was fine, I updated the drivers and installed updates. Downloaded the programs I needed for my college course and downloaded a few games. Everything was fine.<br /><br />I ordered a SanDisk SSD so I could just it in conjunction with my laptop. Let me just say, switching out the optical drive to replace it with the SSD caddy was a pain. The were so many times where it didn't fit, and I was scared of damaging the components inside, however reviewers claimed that shoving it in with force wouldn't be a problem. After some time I managed to fit it in. And I installed the SSD. So that worked for about two days.<br /><br />During the first week of installing the SSD, I started to get dreaded BSOD errors and whatnot. I did some troubleshooting and managed to fix some problems, but new ones would arise. Turns out the SSD became defective from all the errors, so I had to get a replacement.<br /><br />I replaced it with the new one I received and I did a full reinstallation of Windows and viola everything was back to normal again.<br /><br />In the next few weeks, I started getting BSOD errors again and after numerous nearly useless interactions with ASUS customer support I decided enough was enough and this laptop wasn't good for me, so Amazon understood my problem and issued me a refund.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this laptop was really good in its own ways. The design is sleek and nice, its very lightweight, can handle medium to medium-high end games, has decent sound, has an OK matte display, a cool backlit keyboard, etc. But it was also a HUGE fingerprint magnet, it gave me tons of errors, the keys were impossible to see without the backlight, and etc.<br /><br />Overall this laptop might work for others, but not for me. I can see this being used and liked by some casual gamers or just college students for videos and note taking, but for an avid gamer and computer science oriented student, it gave me more problems that I had the tolerance for.","0"

"B0105JD1HE","Acer Aspire E5 17.3 Full HD Gaming Laptop","5","2015-08-23","Not bad.","The Acer Aspire E5- 573G -59C3 BLAH BLAH BLAH... let's cut to the crap! I play league of legends, I make remixes on FL Studio 12, and I watch all my tv shows/movies on this laptop. Don't forget about school work as well. If you're looking for a laptop that can play games on a medium to high setting without putting out a grand on a bombin' laptop then i recommend this! I have zero issues with it so far. The windows 10 update is awwwwweeesssooommeeeee better than the windows 8 that it comes with so if you're hesitant about the new os system (8 that is, coming from a windows 7 to this)  just get it and update it  windows 10. because 10 is great.<br />I don't know about that connectivity issue on that 1 star review but my network card is working pretty well with 5ghz and 2.4ghz networks.<br /><br />- casing around the laptop is kinda weird as in feel and material but it's easy to get use to.<br /><br />the things that i recommend are:<br />a cooling system/fan - cause your tech is cool therefore your tech has to be cool! yah dig?! (the laptop doesn't overheat but I tend to baby my electronics)<br />16gb ram - cause let's be real why go 20 mph when you can go 100 mph. *note adding ram or replacing is kind of tedious, cause you have to remove the back and get to the motherboard. with that stated don't be scared to do it. (we belie....I believe in you!)<br />---------------and optional: it has an open slot for a optical drive! so if you're worried about not having a cd drive you can get one placed in (that's pretty bad-ass if you ask me.)<br /><br /> **if you really wanna fly replace the hybrid hard drive with an ssd  ** yeah that would be crazy but i don't think it's need tbh.<br /><br />this is my first acer laptop and so far it's great! I used to have the n5010 dell insprion which the acer would slay in a head on head battle.<br /><br />in the end if you're a student or even a casual gamer that's looking for an upgrade or stability get this laptop.<br /><br />*the price keeps going up so act fast I got it when it was lower than it is now (8/23/15)","1"

The 4k screen really looks great on most things. I have however noticed that there are some issues with the 3840 x 2160 resolution. Some programs don't display correctly because they (in my best guess) don't have the zoom capability required to be able to see them. A certain programs toolbar displays very small compared to everything else. This isn't so much of an issue as I can still see it, however if your vision is poor you wouldn't be able to make it out. It exists on other programs also, so it isn't just the program.<br />Other stuff:<br />1. The backlit keyboard doesn't turn off and stay off. You can use the function + f9 key to turn it off, but you must do this every time the laptop is turned on. I have researched a lot on the internet looking for a fix for this and haven't found one yet. Although not a huge turn off it is inconvenient for people who don't want to use the backlight.<br />2. Upgrading to windows 10 at first didn't work. The GEFORCE didn't like windows 10 for some reason and would keep freezing even after updating the drivers. I ended up downgrading back to 8.1 and then a few weeks later upgraded to 10 again and everything went smoothly. This may have been an issue with windows itself however it isn't an issue now.<br />3.

"B00MMMMMX2","ASUS ROG 15.6"" Gaming Laptop w/ GeForce GTX860M 2GB GDDR5 and Optimus Technology","5","2015-01-09","Great performance, very satisfied overall.","Purchased this almost 1.5 weeks ago, so bear in mind this should be considered a slightly-more-than-initial impression.<br /><br />First things I noticed was the solid build. Very satisified with the construction and quality of the computer. I'm moving back to a PC laptop after 4.5 years of using a macbook pro 13&#34;.  The keyboard is solid and has a action / feel, and the red back-lighting looks really nice.  The mouse (trackpad?) feels alright, but not the best. The clicking doesn't feel as solid as the rest of the keyboard assembly. Also the senstivity is there, but leaves a little to be desired after moving back from a macbook. Apple does a great job with the trackpad, so it is tough to compare this to that.<br /><br />Visuals and overall feel aside, the computer works phenomenally. I made this purchase because I wanted to be able to run a variety of games in my Steam catalog that don't run on OSX.  These range from FPS (ArmA2, Insurgency) to strategy games (Civ V, Toy Soldiers) and a variety of other games.  This computer is able to handle all of these games on either High or Ultra settings, with no loss in performance.<br /><br />Running a benchmark in ArmA2, the game was able to maintain 60fps at 1920x1080 with maximum details. The game requires a lot of resources, so I was stoked to see that.<br /><br />The fan is quiet, and the computer doesn't seem to get hot unless it is running something like the game mentioned above for extended periods of time. This can also be mitigated by not keeping the laptop on your lap, and on a table or desk instead.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. The computer is powerful, quiet, and looks very slick. It is a republic of gamers series, so I'm sure if you're reading this, you're interested in it's ability to game. Like I said, I've been able to run a variety of different games on high to ultra with no loss in performance. The fan is quiet, which I'm sure is another concern, and it doesn't seem to get exceptionally hot.<br /><br />I'd recommend this laptop.","1"

Performance as expected:  boots in a few seconds, runs modern games smooth.  Screen is rich and bright.  And best of all, the whole thing runs quite.<br /><br />As others have said, the sound is poor (tinny) and for me presently there is what seems like a sound driver-type bug that is routing too much through the left front, causing a rattle at certain frequencies.  (Actually, if I go to the speaker configuration only left and right will make any sound--the woofer seems non-functional, but again it seems like a driver thing that will get fixed.)  Also, as others have said, the upper left placement of the streaming, steam, and function buttons seems poorly thought out--also a steam button on a pc that refused to load the normal pc version of steam seems . . . well, dumb.<br /><br />All and all, I'm keeping it and am pretty pleased with my new couch gaming machine.","0"

This laptop combines a great combination of power and functionality into a reasonably-priced package. Yes, the display could be better - but you must take price point into consideration. To hear the whiners complain about the display of which they obviously never tried to adjust is laughable. It's like complaining about a car seat being too far back without bothering to adjust it properly. The display is easily adjustable to make it brighter and give it more contrast.<br /><br />I added the optical drive caddy to replace the optical drive with another solid state drive - and it rocks. I installed this model: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FWOR638/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />My computer technician eliminated the ridiculous partition in the original hard drive (still leaving a very small recovery partition) which regained me a full C drive. I can't tell you how to do that - but he used a separate computer to copy the drive, first - and then reinstalled it into a single partition.<br /><br />Yes, the finish does show fingerprints - and so do glass tables... so what's the point? The machine doesn't ATTRACT fingerprints - it just shows them... so you're reminded that you need to clean your computer from time to time. Big deal... get over it.<br /><br />The keyboard feels great - and the spacing is quite workable. The lack of an &#34;END&#34; key does suck, though... and the backlit keys aren't that easy to see in the dark. Not a big deal in my case, as I bought this to be a desktop killer - and bought the Kensington Comfort Type USB keyboard to use with it, anyway (a keyboard of which I do recommend, BTW).<br /><br />You will need to hunt down the user manual on Asus' website, as it's not included in the box. No biggie.<br /><br />I haven't had the laptop long enough to put it through enough work to comment further - but I'll come back and append this review when I've done some video editing and other heavy lifting with it.","3"

The thing starts up from cold in literally a matter of seconds and runs all current games at ultra settings without so much as a hiccup. All of this for a fantastic value. You could easily pay another grand to tag on a big name brand, but why bother when this is such a great laptop. For more details on the competition and why this is such a great value I highly recommend the wirecutter website, which ultimately helped sell me on this particular laptop, and I haven't had an ounce of regret since.","3"

The program is large and runs heavy 3D graphics. I decided on it for the RAM and the fact it is expandable  and the Graphics card being the 970M most places were over charging in my eyes.  When I got it I couldn't get the number lock to work, But the call to Amazon was helpful  in getting me to Asus tech support  who was on the phone quickly  and helped, however  there was a fix and they didn't know about it.  If you have problems  getting the number lock on there is an fn button on the bottom  row hit it and the shift lock and the num lock each time you turn it on and you will be good to go. Another thing the back lighting kept going off, the fix to that I googled and hit fn and the f4 button  to increase the keys  back light or fn plus f3 to lower it and it has 3 levels. But so far loving it and the great price.  CON'S  the power cord is in a horrible spot on the right side and it does interfere with the mouse at times, but it falls out quite frequently when on my laptop desk, the other thing is the DVD slot opens as the button is very touchy.  I wish they had a better design on both along with an on or off button for the touch pad, I had to get an app to turn it off.  One other thing that they need is to be able to have a number lock key as everytime I turn it on I have to push the fn, shift and home key to turn on the number pad on the side.  And the above issue with the backlit keys , some of the keys don't show up when in the red but the backlight has stayed since hitting the fn and f4 buttons at the same time.","1"

Rear venting for the fans also reduced the heating of surfaces under the laptop.

"B00NWE9SBS","ASUS G751JY 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","5","2015-02-28","For the price, you can't beat it. Desktop performance on the go.","After about a week of use this laptop has been nothing but a pleasure to game on. The colorful ips panel runs at a silky smooth 75hz (after Nvidia's latest driver update) and the keyboard although not mechanical certainly keeps up with one. This laptop truly is a portable desktop experience. Coming from someone with a custom built $2200 gaming pc that says a lot. The 4gb 980m keeps up with and in most cases surpasses my 770 sli setup due to the extra 2 gigs of dedicated vram. Everything I have thrown at is has performed amazingly without exception. Compared to other laptops in the same price range, you can't beat it. in terms of build quality I would have to give this laptop a 9/10. Everything feels solid and durable. The entire laptop with the exception of the brushed aluminum design has a wonderful soft touch, almost rubbery feel to it. Noise is almost non-existent even under heavy gaming and heat is a non issue since almost all of it is exhausted out the back. My only complaint would be with the audio quality of the built in speakers; While they can be made to operate quite loudly, highs and lows are not replicated very well to any extent. This isn't really bothersome while gaming though. The built in amp however is quite nice for powering headsets and external speakers. In terms of battery life, there really isn't much. You can expect around 3 hours while listening to music or watching videos and about 1 to 2 hours while gaming, depending on the game your running. Keep in mind, the laptop down-clocks almost every hardware component when not plugged in. This results in significantly lower performance when not running off of mains. The issue can be remedied to an extent by turning off nvidia battery boost, but in no way can it be alleviated entirely. Overall I cant really complain when I can tuck it under my arm and carry it from room to room. While the laptop does weigh 8.4lbs, this is a far cry from my 40lbs desktop and certainly shouldn't be an issue or feel uncomfortable for anyone. Lastly I suppose I can talk about the storage. Asus has divided each drive into two separate partitions. While an annoyance if you aren't particularly used to juggling around your programs its not too much of an hassle and actually forces you to manage space effectively. In terms of how fast the pc starts, the quickest time I clocked it came in at 2.5 seconds from a cold start. The slowest start up time (from off to desktop) was 4 seconds flat. This is pretty much the same affair when it comes to writing and reading data. Everything is blistering fast, even when reading or writing on the hdd. Overall, for $2,700 you won't find anything better at the moment. Building a custom pc will only yield marginally better performance numbers and while the laptop can only be upgraded to a certain extent you wont need to even consider it for another 4-5 years unless you absolutely need the best of the best. Although if that is the case you can expect to be buying a $500 video card every year.","2"

The angle of lift is also perfect.  The fans work very well and keep my baby nice and cool.  All in all, I am extremely glad I made this purchase!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The power cable started to crap out after a couple months of use and I submitted a warranty part replacement request with the manufacturer.  It took nearly 4 months to receive the replacement part due to &#34;warehouse issues&#34; CM was having.  I was jerked around by customer support.  Part of why I purchased this cooling pad was the warranty and so waiting 4 months for a replacement power cable that shouldn't have crapped out on me so soon anyway made this purchase a lot less worth it to me.","0"

Obviously he's not a gamer and doesn't know PC's.<br /><br />I looked for over two weeks everywhere and the Lenovo Y50 is the best bang for the buck.  This laptop has a 4GB Nvidia Geforce GTX 860m, on other laptops with that same dedicated card you going to spend at least over $1400-1600 (unless you go with the Acer Nitro which has known issues with WiFi).  This model also comes with an external DVD-R/RW if your wondering.<br /><br />Gaming on it so far has been great, I did have to change the Nvidia tool to make sure its using the Dedicated card instead of on-board graphics, but that's easy.  Diablo 3 ran smooth and under heavy battles didn't skip a beat.  I haven't tried other games just yet, but I will update when I do.<br /><br />Lets go over the Pros/Cons<br /><br />Pro's<br />-Price (under $1200)<br />-Design (Aluminum body with well designed keyboard and doesn't attract fingerprints)<br />-Very sleek and thin (fits like a glove in my Spigen 2 Backpack)<br />-Dedicated Graphics Card (Nvidia GeForce GTX 860m 4GB DDR5)<br />-Matte 1080p LCD Screen (Awesome screen btw)<br />-JBL speakers (sounds great for how small they are)<br />-Powerful (2.6 i7, 16GB RAM)<br />-Decent battery life (Lenovo says 5 hours, I would say real usage about 4, with gaming well not good of course)<br /><br />Cons's<br />-Track-pad (its sensitive enough that while typing if your hand grazes it you'll get back to the Tiles screen)<br />-Lots of Bloatware (c'mon Lenovo nobody wants that, especially if your advertising this for gaming)<br />-HDD (its a &#34;Hybrid&#34; 1TB + 8GB SSD, runs a little slower than a true SSD but its not bad and still runs fast)<br /><br />Obviously the Pro's definitely out weigh the Con's, I will update this after I've had it a month.<br />Overall a great buy, and very happy so far! 5/5","11"

Gameplay is great, able to use high quality settings without sacrificing anything...even temperature.  It appears to be staying really cool, even during hours long LoL gameplay (I do keep it propped up using a small cheap cooler fan pad, just in case).<br />Fast, surprisingly notable difference from my older 2.4ghz.  Power up time is insane, I've never seen anything like it, so fast!<br />Not really seeing that it's really necessary to have both the NVIDIA860M and the Intel Graphics; however, I guess if you set particular programs/games to use the NVIDIA and require others to use the Intel Graphics, you would technically be extending the life of both?<br />The photos don't do it justice.  It's so much prettier than it looks.<br /><br />UPDATE:  in case you noticed previous complaints about the surface and smudginess...this is true.  While at first I thought ummm, really who cares...now I am a bit bothered by it.  Even electronic specific wipes don't really do the trick.  Either way, still not something to change my 5 star rating.<br />UPDATE 2:  The USB ports are kind of sensitive.  I have had issues with controllers disconnect mid game, and having to push USB back into place.  Initially thought it could have been the cheap controller itself, but I have since had the same issues with my cooling fan.  No issue with the tiny mouse USB tho.","3"

FIX IT AMAZON!<br />16GB DDR3L 1600 MHz<br />1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive, 128GB M.2 Solid-State Drive<br />17.3-inch Full HD eDP Anti-glare Screen; NVIDIA Geforce GTX980M with 8GB GDDR5 VRAM<br />BD Burner; Windows 8.1<br /><br />A. PERFORMANCE<br /><br />So far the following games have been tested on my unit:<br />- FAR CRY 4,<br />- ALIEN ISOLATION,<br />- WITCHER 2,<br />- KERBEL SPACE PROGRAM,<br />- TOMB RAIDER,<br />- CS:GO.<br /><br />I ran all the games at MAXIMUM settings with native resolution (1080p). All the games ran 60fps and above with the exception of Witcher 2. In Witcher 2, with all the settings MAXED out and all the SPECIAL FEATURES enabled, you will get some fps drops in particular areas where light is intensive. However, it is playable. If you are fine with turning down bloom and blur effects, the fps drops should dissipate. The GTX 980m with 8gb GPU and i7 4720HQ CPU are very powerful and will use lots of battery life when gaming at such settings, therefore you will need to keep the unit plugged in at all times. Also, the fans can get pretty loud so you should be aware of two things. First, you need to have a headset to null out the fan sounds when gaming. Secondly, you need a flat area, preferably wood or metal, that can provide the decent lift for proper air flow to occur. The cooling system is incredible but does require that smooth flat surface as the back is filled with holes for air to come in and out of. [ :) ] Boot up time is incredible. It seldom takes more than 10 seconds to boot. The writing speeds are also fairly quick on the 1tb harddrive. (around 150mb/s) Overall, the PERFORMANCE on this unit blew my mind away. Laptop gaming at Desktop quality.<br /><br />B. HARDWARE<br /><br />I personally love that this laptop has an optical drive pre-installed on the side of the laptop. Lots ofnew gaming computers are choosing to remove it, but I personally like a laptop that has it. There are 6 USB ports, which come in very handy. The JACK ports for audio are high quality and the sound of the system, when used in companion with the software they provide, named SOUND BLAST CINEMA, is quite astonishing. You will have to manually set the setting for headphone usage in the sound blast cinema, otherwise the sound will be muffed. The screen is very crisp, vivid and clear but could be even better for a $2300 unit. There are more advanced screens that can be incorporated into Laptops. The weight of the unit is not as heavy as I expected for a 17.3 inch laptop. I manage to pick it up and move it around with ease. As far as the keyboard goes, what more can I say rather than the fact that it is a steel series. It is amazing and beautiful to use and to look at. It comes with pre-installed software to customize all of it. However, I do not like the silver buttons on this laptop. They are the turn on button, GPU switch button, and 3 other buttons. They look out of place for such a nice looking unit. They should be rounded, and incorporated into the flat surface of the laptop so it blends better. (personal preference). The feel of the laptop is sturdy and the high quality materials prevails. It is truly well thought out, well designed, and well built.<br /><br />C. Windows 8.1 Issues<br /><br />This is why I gave this unit 4 stars. Many of the win 8.1 apps will not start as they are combating issues with win 7 programs that I have installed. This causes overall functionality of the laptop to drop. I cannot use calendar, mail, agenda, and many other apps that should open with ease. I suspect that many of the issues will be fixed when win 10 comes out, and since you will have a free upgrade from 8.1 to 10, I will wait and see.<br /><br />D. Other issues I ran into<br /><br />- The battery profile tends to reset itself. It will not stay on the default I put it on.<br />-You have to use the gaming center software (i think its called dragon something..) to enable the state of the laptop power usage. In there you have the setting for low, medium, and high performance. This becomes a pain in the arse when you want to switch between integrated and dedicated GPU, as a boot restart is required every time. (read below under battery enhancement to see why)<br />- Some track pad features must also be enabled to be used properly. I still need to figure out how to do it. I might call MSI.<br />- If you are like me, and will install START IS BACK, win 8.1 will try to creep in on the right side of the screen at random intervals. If I cannot find a way to disable that, then I think that's another compatibility issue to look out for.<br />- Battery life is short. Very short. But there is a way to fix that if you are using it for multimedia watching, such as Whose line is it anyway (love that show) and want at least 4 hours out of it.<br /><br />Battery Enhancement:<br /><br />** To achieve 4 hours of media, use the integrate graphics card (Intel HD Graphics) by pressing on the GPU switch button on the laptop (second silver button, counting top to bottom). Then, create a plan that is similar to the power saving plan, but go into the advance settings of the plan and turn cpu maximum management to 90% (youtube it if you do not know what I mean). This will cap the usage of the unit's power to 90%, which is plenty, and will save you lots of battery life. Next, go into the dragon gaming software and change the power usage to low (I still it's called ECO something or green something). And there you go. Now you have a laptop that will last at least 4 hours for watching you tube, Netflix, DVDs, blu-ray, browsing the web, or using any of the productivity software such as word, excel and power point.<br /><br />E. OVERALL THOUGHTS<br /><br />This is a machine that will run your games at incredible settings and incredible speeds (at least for the next 3 years). Gaming at 1080p with 60fps and MAXIMUM settings is beautiful, and when you attach that with sound blast cinema surround sound quality, you might shed a few tears throughout your game plays. Win 8.1 does have some compatibility issues if you use win 7 programs. I did not like that, but since I do not use many of the win 8.1 apps, it is alright to wait until Win 10 comes out. The look of this laptop and build quality are impressive and downright beautiful. I can confidently say that I am a happy customer, and with that in mind, I recommend this product to you as well.<br /><br />Thank you and Happy Gaming!","2"

Probably not the laptop you're looking for if you just want an internet and facebook machine, it's too powerful to waste not using it for demanding tasks. Features I really enjoy: -An average of 8 second start time to usable. Comes in really handy when you need to access something really quick. -Quiet at all times, I have never heard it get louder from extended use. Have had it on longer than 6 hours at a time with no additional noise. Graphic settings turned on high, performance at highest setting. -Stays cool, except the air coming out of the exhaust fan on the left side. DON'T LEAVE ITEMS NEXT TO THE EXHAUST FAN. They get very hot, very quick.  -The keyboard is comfortable to use, Full keyboard and number pad  I have played two PC games online, Tera Online and Titan Fall, both run smooth and have been optimized by the GeForce graphics card.  Cons: Have not been significant enough to lower my rating. Still love this laptop -Screen resolution could be sharper with window boxes, but could be due to software and not hardware. Not a big issue, games are still clear and smooth.  -The power supply cord separated on the converter box slightly. I put some electrical tape on it and have had no problems. Be careful when -handling and storing the cord.","2"

This is what you want!","Great product. I am a daily gamer on my laptop. I just wanted to make sure it stayed cool so I bought this product and it is one of the best. You can spend $30-$50 on other coolers, but they do not last as long, do a poor job, and do not come with the great feature this cooler does. The extra USB ports on the side are a great addition. I love the LED lighting that you can change the colors with a button. And best of all, the fan speed control is great. When I play more demanding games I turn up the fan speed and my laptop stays extremely cool. When I am not playing games i generally leave it on a low fan setting. The rubber cord holders are a great touch but I rarely use them. The only problem I have had is vibration issues when the fan speeds are mid to high. However, I have gotten use to the vibration and generally it goes away when my hand is on my laptop/keyboard.  It is lightweight and easy to carry. I stow it away in my laptop book bag I got for Christmas. Overall a great product and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who has a hot running laptop or games a lot.","0"

I'd give 5 stars if they would have included overnight shipping for both of my replacements, which are affecting my business.<br /><br />I received my first G751 last Thursday (4/2/2015) and noticed a dead pixel.  I called Amazon on Friday and they immediately sent out a replacement that arrived today (Tuesday).<br /><br />I received my second G751 on Tuesday (4/7/2015).  After my first dead pixel issue, I extensively analyzed this one to make sure I wouldn't be overlooking another pixel problem.  Everything turned out fine in that category.  Unfortunately, once I popped in my first CD to begin installing software, it made this terrible grinding and unbalance noise.  I opened the CD drive and noticed the clip where the CD snaps into was bend and missing a snap on one of the springs.  After calling Amazon, they said they were going to pull the entire product off from being sold until the QC issues were solved.<br /><br />I received my third G751 computer this past Thursday (4/9/2015). This one did not have any CD drive or dead pixel issues. However, after installing the SolidWorks CAD software that I use for work (I do SolidWorks mechanical engineering CAD design, FEA analysis, etc.), I noticed it was running the program very slow.  My current laptop is an Asus G75VW that I purchased in 2012 and is still running strong. I decided to run the SolidWorks Performance Bench test for both the G751 and G75VW, and to my unfortunate surprise, the 3 year old G75VW laptop with less performance specs outperformed the G751. I'm very disappointed with ASUS.  Is this a third defective laptop that I've received?  It must be, because the specs of this laptop should run my software must better than my old computer. I will continure trying more testing and seeing if there is anything else I can do to improve performance, but if I can't solve this issue, I will be returning this laptop.<br /><br />UPDATE ON 5/5/2015<br />I had the laptop looked at by a computer tech service and they optimized it as much as possible (getting rid of all the junk software, putting best settings, etc.) and after running the SolidWoks benchmark test, my old G75VW computer did better once again.  It particularly outperformed the G751 in graphics, which makes absolutely no sense.  As of today, I'm returning the G751 for a refund until ASUS sorts out their QC issues.  Lemon # 3.  I'm disappointed in ASUS but thankful to Amazon for their great support throughout this process.","11"

Gaming performance is mediocre, but for its portability, that's some pretty impressive performance it is showing, especially at this price point (gaming performance of this laptop will last a few more years especially since DX12 is coming soon). It runs very cool and quiet at all times, which is a great plus for me. Performance is great overall. For those wanting to increase battery life for this laptop, do set the computer minimum cpu frequency under power options (advanced settings) to 1% instead of leaving it at the usual 10%. Performance will be the same, but battery life increases. And if your laptop cannot charge beyond 60%, it is NOT a manufacturing fault but because lenovo has a neat Conservation Mode on in the Battery Manager app. I am getting four and a half hours of battery life with each charge.<br /><br />The touch screen is awesome and very bright at maximum brightness, but it suddenly becomes a little too dim when you lower its brightness below 85%. With some registry edit it can become better. Screen is reflective, which will definitely hinder your outdoor experience, but... are you sure you want to bring a laptop so big and so heavy out? Some people ask whether the fonts are blurry for a 17 inch screen at this resolution, and no it isn't.  There are also no mustard colour for yellows like its smaller sibling. Lenovo has done a really great job calibrating the colours on this screen, there are no complaints there. It also has one of the widest colour gamut out there, beating even the Macbook Air. Touch screen is really responsive, with no dead zones. The screen is glossy, so dragging your finger across the entire screen will often result in frictional bumps. The hinge is very stiff so, you can expect the screen to stay in place even when using the touchscreen. The bezel for this 17 incher is quite large, but it is less noticeable as the screen estate itself is super big.<br /><br />Keyboard is meh, keyspace is wide (which is good for some people). Not bad at all, but nothing impressive. It is pretty small for the laptop's size, but the typing experience is still decent overall. There will be very little getting use to if you use previously use a Microsoft, Logitech, Asus, HP or Apple keyboard. The numpad is actually very useful, and you can use some additional software to map shortcuts to those buttons. Somehow, my escape key feels a little mushier than the rest, but then again there are some give and takes for a laptop this price. There are some nifty keyboard shortcuts Lenovo provides such as Fn + Space, which can help switch between the three level of keyboard brightness.<br /><br />The trackpad is awesome. It has very good palm rejection and is distanced away from the keyboard a fair bit, so typing is very comfortable. The surface is sufficiently frictioned, which is very good. It uses a cross etched surface, which makes it feel very smooth when your finger moves at any direction. You can customize a middle button click with the software that comes with it too, which is very useful for me as I use it very often to open and close tabs on Chrome.<br /><br />The speaker is awesome. It is very loud and very clear. With its dual speaker array, it definitely feels very surround sound, which is very good for any laptop speakers. The highs are a little tinny, but they are crisp. The mids and the lows are reverberating, which are also very good for gamers out there. The additional subwoofer at the bottom really pumps out some nice 'oomph', which can really be felt. There are some settings to play around with, and that will definitely help with your audio experience. Speakers however collect a bit of dust, but that may just be because where I live is a little dusty.<br /><br />Weight is excessive (likewise for its charger), but when you buy it be prepared to only work around on desk. There are little peripherals provided, which is admittedly a little disappointing. Build quality is very good,no flex for keyboard nor the back of the screen. However, speakers grills are made of plastic, which is a little worrying as there are creaking just days into using the laptop. The front corners of this laptop is rounded, which does not cut into your wrist like some of the sharp edged ultrabooks, so that is a plus point for this laptop. This laptop looks bold, and it is powerful enough to handle most programs, enough to make your friends envious. The three usb ports are more than sufficient for day to day use, no idea why some people complain so much about it. The hot air that comes out of this laptop blows away from the user, so that the surface of this laptop is very cool, although the bottom will be relatively hot, but not burning. You may want to invest in a coolant for the CPU and GPU, but in my opinion that is not necessary.<br /><br />Hard disk speed is okay. Of course a SSD will be way better.","7"

By far the biggest problem is:<br /><br />- Inaccurate color. Bright yellows show up as a muted, mustard color under default settings. You can adjust the settings such that bright yellows, but no other colors, display correctly. Either way this flaw is a dealbreaker for anyone who relies on accurate color reproduction.<br /><br />Other compromises include:<br /><br />- Slight but repetitive and annoying ticking noises. Run a Google search for details. I drown out the problem by listening to music when I use this laptop, but if you must work under silence, this laptop could drive you crazy.<br /><br />- Short 2-3 hour battery runtime even under normal web browsing and document processing.<br /><br />- Large footprint. Barely fits in laptop backpacks designed for 16&#34; laptops.<br /><br />But the strengths are:<br /><br />+ Bright and high-resolution display. Aside from the yellow color issue, text and images look brilliant.<br /><br />+ Keyboard. The most comfortable and accurate, no contest, among dozens of similar laptops I've used. The red backlight is perfect: just bright enough, with no leakage.<br /><br />+ Wireless. Many modern PC laptops suffer weak reception, frequent disconnections, or plain slow speeds.

It does this all very well.  Weight was not a major concern as I only occasionally need it to be portable.  A year ago I purchased an ASUS mulimedia laptop for the same reasons. I liked that machine with its HD IPS display and to its credit it did most things well. However, once I kicked all cores into video encoding, it would shut down with a thernal overload in about 5 minutes - totally inadequate cooling.<br /><br />When I received this G751 model, one of the first things I did was give it an encoding job that ran all cores and the GPU for 6 hours non-stop.  This beast hardly broke a sweat.  The center-rear portion of the keyboard was slightly warm and the fan noise was hardly noticeable even though there was plenty of heat coming out of the rear vents.  Wow!  Well done ASUS!<br /><br />I also do some gaming and this system performs great for this.  I guess it should since that's what it's really designed for.  I'm not a big FPS gamer so I can't speak to that but I've been playing the new release of Elite Dangerous and it runs fantastic with my hotas and trackIR connected.<br /><br />Things I like:<br />* It does everything I want it to do and does it well.  I expect this will be my go-to system for quite a while<br />* The IPS screen is gorgeous and its size does not leave me feeling deprived when I'm away from my external monitor.<br />* With USB 3.0 and NAS storage performance, it's as powerful as any desktop system I could configure in this price range yet it's still portable when it needs to be.<br />* ASUS designed it to be user-expandable for more memory and storage options.<br />* It runs cool and quiet.<br />* With 3 different video outputs, it can be connected to just about any video display - 3 at once if you like although I have not tried this yet.<br />* 802.11ac<br/><br />Things I don't like<br />* My biggest negative is the keyboard.  The feel is fine but I don't really appreciate the non-standard layout features.  I *really* don't like the escape key NOT being the most upper left-hand key - especially for a special function key that I will rarely use.  Same goes the keys that ASUS hijacked from the standard keypad layout - particularly the numlock key.<br />* I'm also disappointed with the keyboard backlighting.  The LEDs are not sufficiently shielded, imho, and glare out from under the keycaps.  Maybe this was done on purpose for some sort of coolness factor (seen a recent Star Trek movie?) but I find it annoying but then I normally use an external monitor and keyboard.<br />* Audio is just okay. Probably the toughest thing to do well on a laptop so hardly a negative.  Normally I have it connected to USB audio mixer or use wireless headphones.  These arrangements sound fantastic.","5"

This machine is fast! The CPU is actually a 4810MQ  running at 2.8 - 3.8 GHZ. The screen is outstanding as well, especially for a non IPS screen. For photo-editing I checked it out by editing one of my last minute \\""end of year\\"" senior picture packages and when compared to my normal setup, the results were very good. You could certainly use this one on location to perform quality editing, and the fact that it provides output options for an additional 3 screens with two of them supporting 4k output is a big plus. Add your own 24\\"" plus IPS monitor if you need to - Desktop power in a laptop body.    Now for Video Editing - In my normal workflow I usually use three separate video files supporting 1080P/60 along with at least one or two external audio files and I mix them in Movie Edit Pro 2015. Needless to say, even while I was making a number of cuts between the various video files, along with adding several transitions and effects curves, the MSI Dominator didn't even break a sweat.  While this machine uses the Nvidia 870m graphics card equipped with 3 gigs of GDDR5 memory instead of one of the newer (and more expensive) Nvidia 970/980 Maxwell cards, you should have no problem working with and editing not only hi-def 1080P video but you should also be able to handle some of the latest 4k video out there as well. For $1199.00 it is doubtful that you will find another machine with this kind of power contained in a portable form anywhere, at least not in January-2015. It's no \\""light-weight\\"" and it might be a little heavy for someone who is used to carrying a netbook or tablet, but for those who need the most power and bang for their buck, this can't be beat.    Another bonus for me that is worth mentioning - you can shut the screen off at the push of a button without shutting down the whole machine. How many times have you needed to step away froma project and wanted to keep prying eyes away or just needed to conserve power because you were away from the outlet? While it boots up really fast, I still don't like shutting things down in the middle of a project and for me this is a great feature.    You can also turn off the touch pad at the touch of a button via a button located just above and to the left of the touch pad, and this is nice if you would like to add a mouse or other control device to your system without having to worry about the track pad interfering with those devices.    The four audio ports include a microphone jack, a head phone jack, a LINE-in jack, and a line out jack. The nice thing about having a dedicated LINE-in jack is that it gives you a great way to import quality audio from other external devices such as mixing boards, keyboards, other gaming systems and I'm sure you can think of some others on your own. For those who work with audio mixing this is just another extra that you won't find with most laptops.     And here's something I haven't seen mentioned in these review, those audio jacks also perform double duty as surround sound outputs if you need to use them. Assuming your movie or game supports surround sound, why just use the \\""line-out\\"" or \\""headphone out\\"" jacks which support stereo only? If your entertainment system has an amplifier that supports input from surround sound sources, put it to good use.     The microphone jack is used for the center and sub-woofer speaker.  The Line-in Jack is used for the rear speakers.    And the Line-out Jack is used for the surround speakers.    And speaking of sound, the sound from these laptop speakers is top notch; You probably won't find higher quality sound in another laptop this size, louder -maybe, but without great audio quality, noise is noise and these are pretty loud in their own right - Having a dedicated sub-woofer is very welcome.    Other things worth mentioning in passing, the keyboard is very well designed and very responsive and just having the capability of lighting up your keyboard is a big plus for anyone typing things out in a low light environment; The fact that you have programmable color lighting options is a nice addition.    Bottom line, if you're looking for a quality portable editing platform and gaming platform that won't break the bank, look no further- this one is hard to beat.     It might be a little on the heavy side but if power is what you want, this machine has it.     Computer Upgrade King has made a great machine even better by upgrading the memory from 8 gigs to 16 gigs as well as adding a Blu-ray burner in place of the standard DVD-RW drive, and somehow they managed to do this without adding anything to the regular list price.  Bottom line - A great laptop at a great price. This one won't be obsolete in a year.","4"

Amazon lies to its customer!","I must have been the most unfortunate customer buying Lenovo Laptop. I have ended up returning and exchanged 4 times. The first one I received, the touch-pad did not work with multi-fingers. The second one, I only used it for 5 days and the fan started making some weird grinding noise. The third one, the touch-pad was excessively loosened. It seemed like out of the place and produced loud noise when tapping it, even with just a light touch. The 4th one came to me with the same loosened touchpad like the 3rd one. Both the 3rd one and the 4th were manufactured exactly on the same day, month and year. OMG!    I would expect a much better quality from a $1,000+ laptop. But this is not the product that I want to use in the long term. I would not recommend it at all. I should have spent couple hundreds more to get an Asus ROG or MSI instead of Lenovo. The laptop seems more like a joke to me.    Amazon Customer Services also lies to customer horribly. There was one agent (I would like to hide the name) told me that if I would like to keep the loosened-touchpad laptop, he would give me 20% discount. Well, then by the time I called Amazon Customer Services and told a representative on the line that I would want to keep the laptop and request that 20% discount, she said that it is violating Amazon policy and that she could not do that! I cannot believe that two agents from the same company tell different stories to their customer like this. I have been shopping on Amazon for many years and I cannot believe this is happening to me. If you folks were me, what would you think? I am speechless!    Here is the exact copy from the 20% discount promise from Amazon customer services that I mentioned above.    \\""Hello,     I'm sorry to hear about the problem you had with your \\""Lenovo Y50 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Gaming Laptop\\"".     However, I want to make this right for you so I'd like to offer you two options:     1. If you're interested in keeping the item, I'd like to offer you a refund of 20% off the price.     2. We will replace the entire set at no additional charge. You will need to return the item back.     I hope one of these solutions is satisfactory. Please write back and let us know which option you would prefer to choose. We will take care of it for you.     Please visit the following link to provide the information we requested:     http://www.amazon.com/rsvp-mi?c=bccyvuqt3694810428&q=o2r     One of our aims at Amazon.com is to provide a convenient and efficient service; in this case, we haven't met that standard. I'm truly sorry, and I hope you'll give us another chance in the future.     We look forward to hearing from you soon.    Best regards,    [Agent's Name]\\""    Of course, to be fair, this Laptop is very light weighted and has good performance in terms of CPU and GPU. But if folks ask me, I definitely say that please stay away from Lenovo and/or buying laptop from Amazon. You might end up just like me. Extremely frustrated!    May God bless you all!","1"

I purchased this to replace my G72GXRB009 Quad core Machine which served me well for years but the GTX260M is not cutting it anymore.  When buying a high end gaming machine there is Important factors to consider as many gamers are tech Enthusiast's as well.    1. The service ability to Access the CPU and GPU fans, Ive always cleaned them easily on the g72 twice a year and they do clog up and it will run hot.  This g751 Does not have any access to clean them without total disassembly which is not for everyone.  Imagine Buying a car and you cannot open the hood! Except taking the Front end off..    2. Once my GTX260M Had Video issues after a few years, so I was able to order a replacement card and swap it easily and for a couple hundred it was good as new again and has been since.  Be aware what you order as in CPU and What GPU because you are stuck with it forever! they are Soldered to the motherboard BGA! There's no possible way to ever upgrade or replace them sadly :(    So If and when your GPU ever fails Your choice is to Replace the entire motherboard, Which is fine for a Cheap mainstream notebook Not acceptable on a top notch Gaming rig. Also when the next Best GPU arrives in six months you'd have to buy another machine to get it. That's like Buying a new Xbox every year.    3. After a week using this machine is does run My games at the highest settings flawlessly and amazing quality.  but today I went to Install Crysis, The DVD rom stopped working Rebooted several times and Nothing its not even showing in my computer,  Under device manager its showing a driver issue and i've tried to update and it says \\""the best driver is already installed\\""  I've changed nothing here and I cant even install any more games. This shouldn't be on a brand new machine.    4 The battery isn't even easily removable   so if you ever have a hard crash and need to Cold Boot or just replace the battery Yup Tear it all apart!  No thanks these Features are a huge deal breaker for me.  I Really Loved My Asus G72GX But  Ill be returning this and looking for something More Customizable.","2"

It only takes 15 seconds to power ...","I bought this one I have tested this laptop for a month and I can say&#62; This laptop specs are awesome!. It only takes 15 seconds to power on. Microsoft Word runs in just 2 seconds. About gaming, actually, I used NVIDIA GeForce Experience Software to set automatically the optimal video settings for some games I installed, and it took &#34;ultra&#34; settings in almost all. In some games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, I got a maximum of 400 FPS in Ultra settings (in 60 Hz displays there is no a big difference, but you can see how faster your GPU processes your graphics).<br />The Display is pretty cool, I really don't understand why people complain about the display, it has really sharp details and it's matte finish helps you to look clearer at your display instead of looking at your reflect. I was used to IPS displays and this is the first time I use a matte display, and I really like it. Text blurring in some programs is not a problem with the display of this model, it's a general problem of all high DPI (high density of pixel per inch) displays with win 8.1. To solve this, you just have to right click on the program icon (that one which you have the prob), on compatibility tab, disable auto scale for high DPI displays, and there you have, sharp text again. I guess this problem will be solved soon.<br />The surface finish looks great and nice but every single inch of it loves to get you fingerprints. And finally, this laptop doesn't have a powerful sound engine, but it's ok, so it's not a problem to me. So I rate this PC 4.5 out of 5, and I can say it has the best price/specs rate laptop I could find. 100% Recommended!","1"

I sent it in to Razer Support a few months back for a multitude of problems; the fans would rattle no matter what speed, the left mouse click below the trackpad wouldn't work half the time, the trackpad would randomly stop working, the webcam flashes between normal color and blueish tint anytime you try to use it and one of the USB ports stopped working. Now, I have more problems; the left mouse still only works half the time, the webcam still flashes whenever you use it, the trackpad will randomly stop working when I start up the laptop, and, the latest one, the laptop will frequently blue screen or just stop working because of a graphics error. This happens all the time. I could be watching a movie, I could have it sitting on my desk with just the desktop up, and it happens more often when I open the laptop up after being in sleep mode for any period of time. I've tried disabling the discreet graphics card, doesn't work. I've tried a factory reset, which you can't do because Razer does not provide you with any of the Windows media because they expect you to send it in every time something is wrong with it.<br /><br />I am a college student that frequently travels and works with a multitude of different software. I use it for programming, watching movies, editing movies, listening to music, some light gaming, web browsing, etc. I do all my heavy gaming, CAD work, 4k video editing, etc. on my desktop which  I built to handle the tasks it performs. I only rely on my laptop to work for such simple things and it falls short. Now don't get me wrong, this laptop was great for the first 3 or so months that I owned it. Which is perfect for anyone that has the time to keep sending it in to Razer so all they do is perform a factory reset or if you are rich enough to buy a new one every few months. Either way, not a good long term, reliable product. It's so bad, I'm switching to a Mac.","6"

The amazon rep I worked with wasn't helpful either.<br /><br />The good: now that I have a good copy, this is a phenomenal machine with huge performance and beautiful construction. The display is bright, crisp, and has awesome viewing angles with beautiful color reproduction; and since it's a matte display, you don't get much glare.<br /><br />The gpu and cpu package is very strong, though battery life even with modest Internet browsing with a movie running affords me about 3 or 4 hours. But given its purpose, I don't have a problem with that.<br /><br />One of the nice things is its finish quality. It's keyboard is backlit very nicely, the lid has a piece of machined aluminum on it, the exhaust ventilation is stunning, and the whole body has a beautiful texture and solid feel to it.<br /><br />Despite being very upset at the two bad units I recieved, I'm very happy with the good one I have now.","0"

I was initially worried about the the cooling system on this particular laptop. The other ASUS ROG gaming computer seemed to have a superior cooling system, with duel cooling fans in the back. Thankfully my ASUS has preformed excellently under high temperatures. Just make sure to not cover up the left hand side where the fan transfers all the hot air from the cpu and graphics card. Personaly I like to put my laptop on a book and work from there, this ensures that the laptop will never overheat. As for the specs  I mentioned above that I was able to play far cry 4 on ultra, while running other programs like chrome. The 16 gigs of ram seem to be very sufficient for gaming. As for video editing or rendering, I have not tried that yet, but I think the computer would preform nicely. The i7 2.5 ghts really packs a punch, It has been able to handle skype, league of legends, steam, itunes, and chrome, seamlessly. As for the harddrive, I bought the model with a 1000Gigs, the harddrive is actually split into two even 537 gig harddrives. Since its a 7200 RPM harddrive getting the ssd was really not needed. Another reason why I am very pleased with this ROG is because it is a 15.6 in computer that will pack into a backpack and travel nicely. I am so glad that I do not have to try and lug around a 17in laptop to school and back everyday. The keyboard is nice, maybe a little cramped with the numberpad on the right hand side. As for the touch pad, I rarely use it, but I think its ok, not amazing but just ok. Over all the ASUS ROG GL551JM-DH71 Has been a wonderful laptop, I have run many games and programs on it, never once stalling or crashing. only con is that the battery is like 2.5 hours.....but if you consider what this computer is capable of duh its battery life is gonna go down fast. If you want a laptop with a better battery, buy a chrome book.","1"

The problem here is however, that it sometimes lags. I just recently found out that the lag is due to the slow hard-drive, only 5400rpm. Eventually this hard-drive becomes such a problem that it takes 2 min to boot up, and I still have to wait for several minutes before I can properly begin work.

When I first received my Lenovo Y50 I was very excited to experience my very first \\""Gaming\\"" laptop. I had no idea what I was in for. I guess I'll break it down in terms of pros and cons. I am somewhat tech savvy and can find my way around most computers pretty easily. I Owned my Lenovo Y50 for a little over a month before returning it. In this time I used my Lenovo for Gaming, Music, Videos, Social Media and whatever else I needed.<br /><br />Here are the Pros:<br /><br />Very nice casing: It has a aluminum feeling to it. (But it is definitely a fingerprint magnet like everyone has been saying)<br /><br />Very speedy laptop: you can zip around your laptop very quickly and there were little to no hick ups in performance at all.<br /><br />Gaming was okay: you could run most games that you would play on an Xbox 360 or a PS3 pretty good.<br /><br />External DVD/CD Drive: It had came with a External DVD/CD drive that came in handy and was very easy to use!.<br /><br />Now I will list the cons and my horrible experiences with this laptop<br />Cons:<br /><br />Terrible display: I was coming from a Macbook Pro that wasn't even a \\""Full HD\\"" display and the difference in screen quality was night and day.<br />The viewing angles are really bad, the color is very washed out looking.<br /><br />Track Pad: The track pad was awful, it definitely took some time to get familiarized with it. Even when I had adjusted it, it was still pretty bad. I used a mouse for the first couple weeks of owning this laptop.<br /><br />The Plastic Lining around the screen: Alright so when you first get the Lenovo Y50 they have the plastic film covering the lining around your screen, well when I had pulled that off a piece got stuck so I had to pick at it to get it off and after I accomplished that I had noticed a TERRIBLE scratch that was permanently stuck on the plastic liningaround the screen, even after cleaning it with a microfiber cloth it still left terrible hairline scratch marks. Also dust likes to get stuck underneath the screen lining so that can be very frustrating as well.<br /><br />The Notification Lights seeped out through the casing: So what I mean by this is that the notification lights that tell you that your computer is charging on the front of the laptop had a problem. The aluminum casing was not flush with the laptop so the light seeped through it. Very annoying and very irritating in low lighting areas. I tried to see if I could fix it but there was nothing I could do. So I figured I'd deal with it and cover up the lights with a little sticker.<br /><br />The keyboard showed a glossy wear: So after owning this laptop for only about a month the space bar developed a slightly glossy wear to it. I feel like in only a month this shouldn't have happened that quickly. I bought a cover to use with it so I wouldn't create anymore wear but who wants to try and type with a rubber cover over your keyboard?.... NOT ME!.<br /><br />and the FINAL con that made me decide to return this laptop......<br />The screen decided to start flickering......YEP! after only owning this laptop for a little over a month the screen decided to start flickering. Now let me be VERY CLEAR, I am extremely cautious with my electronics and I take VERY good care of them so there is NO reason why this should be happening in such a short time owning this laptop. I wouldn't have been so upset if this may have occurred within two years of owning this laptop but I have only had it for a little over a month and this problem started. I noticed it when I moved the screen of the laptop as far back as it could go while adjusting the screen for a better viewing angle. Out of no where the screen decided to start flickering. I was pretty upset and I have returned my Lenovo in hopes to get a full refund. You pay a good amount of money on something you expect it to atleast last you a few years before you start to see any major problems. I am extremely upset with my purchase and after all these problems I realize that it's just not worth that amount of money for a product of this quality.","4"

I got an open box version and i've had no issues at all. I replaced the HDD with an SSD, but that was more personal preference than anything wrong with the laptop. I'm giving it 4 stars because, like most laptops that have shipped with windows 8, I've found using any recovery media like a restore disc results in an activation error. These new windows 8 supported laptops are supposed to have the serial key encrypted and stored on the motherboard, but both this laptop and numerous dell laptops I've worked on have all had the same issue. Calling microsoft results in being told to contact the manufacturer. Contacting the manufacturer results in being told, &#34;no, that's impossible. It should automatically activate with the embedded serial key&#34;. So I gave up and cloned the old drive.","1"

There are only two things about it that I would change:<br />1. I would like to be able to bend the screen a little further back (right now it goes to about the 100-110 degrees.<br />2. The escape key should be swapped with the recording button, or the recording and macro keys should be moved to the right.<br /><br />These are extremely small issues.<br /><br />I've so far played the following games on ultra settings with maximum AA/HBOA/etc.:<br />Battlefield 4<br />Battlefield 3<br />Battlefield: Bad Company 2<br />Mass Effect 3<br />Deus Ex: Human Revolution<br />Titanfall<br />Many others that would obviously play well given the above.<br /><br />I'm an engineer, so I use a variety of IDEs. I've used the following software (most of them simultaneously) and they were all extremely responsive:<br />Android Studio (this is quite a hog)<br />Google Chrome with like 50 tabs open (don't judge me)<br />Photoshop CS2<br />Visual Studio Pro 2013<br />CooCox CoIDE (eclipse based ARM IDE)<br />Google SketchUp<br />Digilent Waveforms<br />Saleae Logic<br />DesignSpark PCB 7<br />Sketchbook Pro 6<br />MPLAB-X<br />Other small stuff.<br /><br />Really happy with the connectivity on this thing. 4 usb 3.0 ports is great when you have to have multiple development boards hooked up at once with a mouse or phone, etc. Full size HDMI and a gigabit ethernet port are excellent additions too. I keep accidentally opening the blu-ray drive every time I move the laptop. Haha, I'm getting used to it, though.<br /><br />The power adapter is not &#34;magsafe&#34; or anything like that. It's a standard coaxial type connector. Unlike most coax style plugs, though, this one has a very strong strain relief and comes in at a 90 degree angle. The charger is an excellent quality power supply, too. It's a Delta Electronics brand supply, which is good.<br /><br />Side note: Streaming video works great too (Netflix, etc.).<br /><br />The laptop handles like a workstation and plays like a gaming PC. Extremely happy with this purchase. Also, if you're worried about getting the 500 dollar upgraded version of this, the better core i7 processor it comes with (4860HQ I believe) is not necessary. The 4710 works great for everything I've done.<br /><br />Also note that the only difference between this i7 and the more expensive version is the embedded graphics (Iris pro). Since it has a dedicated graphics card and doesn't use Optimus switching, this is basically irrelevant unless you're using the CPU to do hardware video encode/decode instead of the nvidia GPU (don't know why you would do this). Because of the integrated graphics, the 4860 will also have a much larger cache on-chip, which could be why the benchmarks are so much higher (but won't really affect everyday use that much). Benchmarks are designed to fit in the CPU cache to achieve higher performance.<br /><br />I was worried that a 1080p screen would be a little too small, but after coding and using graphics editors for a while I am perfectly content with the 1080p. For anyone that doesn't know, they used a 1080p LCD because graphics cards are still incapable of driving games at 2k/4k type screens at decent framerates.<br /><br />The LCD is beautiful, by the way. Very clean and bright. I love the semi-matte screen - it doesn't reflect annoyingly and it's not washed out like matte screens can be.<br /><br />Battery life is very blarg. Maybe 2 hours. I didn't care about this at all when I got the laptop. Does anyone expect good battery life for a computer like this?<br /><br />Love this laptop!oo (Netflix, etc.).<br /><br />The laptop handles like a workstation and plays like a gaming PC.

BTW, i did not installed anything up to this point. Tried to contact MSI support (by phone and email), but no answer from them. My first solution was to download all the windows updates. It was a though task due to the fuc**ng BSoD or the ramdom restart of the OS. After that the same history. I tried also to &#34;refresh&#34; the OS 3 times, but the problem continues.  - The sound could be better (a gaming laptop as the MSI GS60 deserves)  PRO: At the 3rd day,i was really upset due to all the mentioned problems (return it back! crossed my mind), but suddenly everything works as supposed to be. The laptop is really fast (10% of my HDD is already full of everything): For gaming in ultra/high video configuration, video editing, rendering some architectural designs, multitask.

I decided to upgrade to a better one and went in search of the newer Alienware laptop since I fell in love with the first one. I am not a hardcore gamer, but do enjoy the occasional high-graphics computer game, so I am not able to comment on that level. But I have to say that this computer runs fast! Quick start up, quick response time, crystal-clear picture, and great sound. Aside from that, I'm really drawn to how this notebook is built. I have read several reviews on Alienware users complaining about the overall thickness of this laptop's built. Personally, I am not a fan of the &#34;ultra-thin&#34; laptops and like my laptops to have a little &#34;bulk&#34;.<br />One downside may be that this laptop does not have an optical drive, but then again from researching dozens of laptops before settling for an Alienware, internal optical drives are becoming more and more rare.<br />Overall I am very pleased with this purchase; it is well worth the money.","22"

Everything works very well into this particular distribution, though it did take a bit of trial and error to find the best version of Nvidia's proprietary driver for this particular graphics chipset.  But once I did, I was very satisfied, installing & running Bioshock Infinite.  I haven't really played too far into it, but I've made it into the city and performance has been decent other than occasional FPS dips when a new area loads.  The overall build quality of this laptop is very sturdy.  I particularly love the responsiveness of the keyboard, and it's very nice to have a numberpad on a 15.6 inch laptop.  The touchpad itself is great, but the button leaves a bit to be desired, and just doesn't feel quite right.  The speakers are amazing and put just about any other set of laptop speakers to shame.  Bottom line - this is a great laptop with some nice specs for the price range.  You should be able to play all but the most demanding modern games at medium or better detail without much trouble.","5"

"B00SB7HYU8","MSI GT80 TITAN SLI-009 18.4-Inch Gaming Laptop","5","2015-04-03","Another great laptop from MSI!","Simply amazing one of the best laptops on the market. The 1080p screen is sharp and detailed with good viewing angles and no glare. The fans can be loud if you rev them up manually to 100 percent. but in a normal gaming situation the fans will be audible but not annoying. If you need more battery life simply press the GPU switch located above the touch pad and it will disable the SLI 980M's and switch to the integrated GPU after a restart. The keyboard is amazing, its the look and feel of a desktop keyboard and the cherry mx brown switches feel great. Also you do get Gold WASD keys and a MSI key if you mail a voucher in. You do get a palm rest and a backpack. The sound quality is the best I've heard on laptops the speakers are loud and sound great, if you crank the fans up to 100 percent and you put the speakers at a high level you will not notice it. To give you an idea of FPS I got on ultra on ARMA 3 40-60 FPS and Dying Light gave me a solid 60 on ultra. If you have watched reviews you will most likely have heard of the haptic feed back on the numpad, that has been removed by MSI and only Prototype units have it so if you thought you received a damaged unit don't worry its not broken thats just the way it is. Also most reviewers complain the the touch pad is not usable, I disagree its a great touch pad and I have used it on a multitude of occasions. I have used the top of the line ASUS laptops and this beats them in every way. Plus when a new M GPU is released MSI will upgrade it for you for a cost of course. But overall this is a solid laptop and you wont have wasted money with it.","10"

I upgrade laptops about every 2 years to keep up with times as well as improve my work flow. My last laptop was an Asus N53Sv which still does the job with an I7 2360. 16GB memory and Nvidia 540m ... I decided to go with Asus again since I had a great experience with my last laptop from them. With the advancment of video cards and intel processors I have recieved a super boost with editing high def video... Adding effects and rendering video is no struggle at all for this laptop and its specs. The IPS screen is beautiful after being calibrated. The build of the laptop is solid and even a little lighter than the N53. It smudges very easily however on the body, lots of finger prints... But that is not a major concern of mine. It appears to be a work horse... Time will tell.. I am not a gamer, so I cant speak to that aspect at all. For multimedia consumption this laptop is more than enough... The screen and speakers can be manipulated with the software pre installed to get the optimal results from them. I would say this is a winner. If you dont do any type of gaming or editing on this laptop then it is probably over kill for you.","52"

You'll want this laptop!","I bought a 'like new' one from amazon warehouse deals to save a few bucks.  I waited 2 months to write this review, as to give it a good amount of time to thoroughly review it.  Here's my thoughts.<br /><br />1) Hardware, Construction & Quality<br />I'm coming from a retina 15 macbook pro, so the feeling of plastic is a little different than aluminum.  I STILL think that macbooks are the best made product.  This is the BEST WINDOWS laptop I've ever used.  It is SOLIDLY built.  The Hinge is extremely thick and solid.  Best hinge system I've seen.  The keyboard are chick-let keys, alot like my macbook, and i like them.  I did not have any problems/dead pixels and the 'like new' condition was actually new, most likely a dent in the box, worth the savings.<br />The 980m is the fastest mobile chip on the market today.  It MAKES this laptop.<br /><br />2)  Keyboard<br />I like the keyboard alot.  It ONLY glows red. You can set the brightness three levels. It has programmable keys at the top left of the keyboard.  3 are programmable wish asus software, one is a dedicated Steam button (that opens steam in full screen) and the other is Nvidia Shadow Play button to record your gameplay (only).  The F keys all do extra things (like brightness and volume) BUT you have to push the FN key first.  Coming from a Mac, I HATE THIS.  This and the fact that the top left button is the shadow play button and NOT the esc key are the two downfalls of this keyboard layout. Finally the dedicated gaming center key. It is located where the Num lock key used to be (stupid) You'll never use this as game center is stupid and a waste of resources and space.<br /><br />3) Screen<br />I was worried.  I came from a 4k (retina) screen and i was &#34;downgrading&#34; to a 1080p screen.  Boy, was i wrong.  Its gorgeous.  Its a IPA screen but can be set (via the nvidia settings) to run up to 100hz!  Colors are perfect and I think its a superior screen to most gaming laptops out today.<br /><br />4) Software<br />Windows 8.1  I think most people don't like it, but i think its good.  Metro side is useless, but this debate will end when windows 10 comes out (which you can run on this now using the tech preview, I havent tried it yet though).  Bloatware is minimal.  I ALWAYS do a fresh wipe anyways, but the programs I would uninstall are, asus live update, as it never finds anything new, game center (metro app that does nothing but hog resources), and the network program, as its screws up the internet.<br />Bluray software does NOT come with it, but there is a free program called Lewwo Bluray player that works awesome!<br /><br />5) Performance<br />Yeah, if you found this laptop, your already looking for the best you can buy in a laptop.  I was only looking at ones that had 980m, and there were only 3 to choose from, this, the alienware, msi dominator. This easily won hands down due to the screen (100hz!) and the gsync drivers (alpha, google search it!)  Mine came with 24gb, but i bought a 8 gb stick to get to the 32gb that can max it out.  It was a waste as I'll never use the 24gb but i hated that this beast wasn't maxed out!  I've done alot of chat on the ROG forums about finding the latest drivers to maximize performance, so check that site out and READ...I wont go into all that here since its all on the forums.<br />The PCIe x4 SSD is CRAZY CRAZY fast, 1000 read/write, MUCH faster than sata 6 ssds.  NOTE:  there are three spots for storage drives, 1 PCIe x4 slot, 1 sata 6 slot UNDER the PCIe x4 Slot and one sata 3 slot to the right of the sata 6 slot.  WHY they did this I'll never understand.  Do yourself a favor and get he PCIe x4 drive either 256 or 512 model.  worth the cash (i have the 256 model (jy)).  The 1 tb drive is great a storage drive/game drive.<br /><br />6) Sound<br />The sound is the weakest part of this laptop.  The speakers are at the hinge, facing the user, with one sub at the bottom of the laptop.  Its a bit louder than the macbook pro I had, but at higher levels the sound is a bit distorted.  The original drivers made the sound come out of only one side of the speakers, the newer drivers fix that so make sure to update your drivers!  I've connected the hdmi out on the laptop to my tv/avr and sound comes out of the hdmi great (as well as video).<br /><br />7) Battery<br />It has a non replaceable battery but lasts about 4 hours with internet use (maybe 2 or so with gaming at 30fps).<br />The power brick is HUGE.  Bigger than the xbox one.  Also, the power plug into the laptop is L shaped, and inserts into the laptop.  I hope it doesn't break.<br /><br />8) Cooling<br />The fatness of the laptop is for the cooling.  This thing stays VERY cool and Very quiet even after hours of gaming.  Never burns my legs (does get warmish).  Cooler than mac book easy and quieter.<br /><br />9) Conclusion<br />I bought it, so you should to!  Its a baller laptop with more power and runs most games over 60fps, some well into the upper 100s (shadow of morder ran at 70-100 on maxed settings)  Heres my highlighted pros/cons list:<br /><br />Pro:<br />980m Fastest/best video card in existence today<br />seemingly gsync compatible (find the alpha driver that enables this)<br />IPS screen goes to 100 HZ<br />Cool/quiet<br />24gb memory standard (you'll never use it all!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sound distorts at higher levels<br />Programmable keys where you expect other keys to be from muscle memory<br />YOU WILL KEEP HITTING THE BLUE-RAY drive open when you move it.<br />If you use a USB mouse like i do (razor death adder) and are right handed, the location of the USB slots are in the way of the mouse movement.<br />weight (but duh, if your buying this for gaming, you know its heavy and aren't taking farther than the desk to the couch)<br /><br />I love this laptop and haven't looked back since i bought it.

I have had great luck with it over the years, and when it came time to upgrade, I went back to Asus.<br /><br />These are beefy, performance oriented laptops.  That is the long and short of it.  I REALLY like how the heat-sinks and fans work.  I love how it vents out the back, with a lot of airflow, yet, because there is such a wider area of venting, the fans themselves run a little slower and are quiet.<br /><br />I've been running Evolve on this laptop without any issues.  The screen is great, and looks good from a very wide angle.  I love that aspect.  I don't have to face it towards a person directly for them to see the image.  I'm also a photographer, and this has been WONDERFUL, since I didn't have to find the \\""sweet spot\\"" to look at the laptop right.<br /><br />Now, for the negatives.  I ALMOST left this 5 stars.  It is more of a -.75 star, in reality, so I rounded.<br /><br />First.  There is NOT a removable battery.  This was the REAL WTF about the laptop.  Laptop batteries have a life, and if I want to extend that life, I'd really like to be able to replace the battery.  My older laptop is only a few years old, and the battery discharges very quickly, and will turn off the laptop without any warning.  I am concerned about this laptop, because of that.<br /><br />Second, I hate the hinge.  It is across the center, and looks good, but every time I open the laptop, the hinge and screen flex noticeably.  I'm trying to break the habit of opening from the corner, and do it from the center.<br /><br />Third, I really dislike the location of the audio ports.  In my older model, they are on the left.  In this model, they are on the right.  That means they can be a problem when using a mouse (right handed).  This one is not a major issue, but I believe it was a bad design decision.<br /><br />Fourth, there is no recovery media.  If I am spending close to $2k on a laptop, they can ship therecovery on a thumb drive.  At the price point of thumb drives, that is horrible customer service.<br /><br />So, the long and the short of it.  I like the laptop, and would easily buy it again, if I was back in the market.  They are spendy, but you get some awesome performance.","1"

"B004G603E2","CM Storm SF-19 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad with Two 140mm Turbine Fans (SGA-4000-KKNF1)","5","2015-05-17","A great unit, but a slight redesign woud be even better.","This is a great product with a couple useless features but I still would highly recommend it.<br /><br />First off I bought it for a smaller laptop than it's radius, which i use for work, this was the only unit with multiple fans and a fan speed control which can be manually adjusted that I could find online.<br /><br />I'm a tall dude (6.2) so this sits in my lap perfectly, keeping both myself and my laptop cool continuously.<br /><br />The laptop that I'm using is older and I'm looking to build a new one soon to replace it, however heat and reliability of a power  supply is a major concern for me since I work on these things all day.<br /><br />The light system which is there for gamers I suspect is pretty useless to me as a feature. It looks nice and all, but it's not needed. The USB ports work fine, though I've read they can be fragile so I avoid using them unless I run out of ports. The power cable has been reliable and sturdy so far, which is a plus. Overall I really love this unit, but I wish it had some way to manually &#34;grab&#34; and &#34;frame&#34; whatever sized laptop you place o it. I would buy this again ether way however since I've gotten used to it.<br /><br />As for reliability, it's been a month so far and no problems or issues. It is however large so if you don't have a good sized laptop bag this will not be portable should remain for home or work use. Overall though...going smaller would be detrimental in my opinion for many other reasons. Firstly if I change to a larger laptop this unit will still be useful in the future. And second I can't imagine a smaller unit being comfortable sitting in my lap. Lastly, the air radius of two fans is far superior to a single fan when it comes to keeping a laptop cool, since different designs place components which generate lots of heat in different areas.","1"

My previous laptop started crashing under almost any stress, so I thought I'd upgrade. This laptop was able to do pretty much anything I wanted, although I didn't push it very hard. I played some League of Legends and Dark Souls 2 on the highest settings available, and had pretty awesome framerates.<br /><br />I ended up returning this laptop initially because there were weird lights/colors seemingly bleeding through the screen. It was very noticeable when the screen was black or another dark color. There were just random patches of a soft, glowing green coming through the display. I received a replacement and didn't have the same issue. About a week before my deadline for returning it, I discovered that one of the USB ports would not remain connected. It'd stay connected long enough for me to browse a directory on an external drive, only to lose track of the drive moments later. File transfers were pretty much impossible.<br /><br />I ended up returning the second one and did not get a replacement. It was a very nice laptop, but after thinking about it for a while, I decided it wasn't nice enough to warrant the price. Had either of the two laptops not had issues, I'd still be using it and probably enjoying it. Instead I'll probably put together a more economical desktop and spend the excess refund on peripherals like some nice monitors.<br /><br />If you want portable, powerful gaming capability, this should get the job done.","1"

It's a shame to have a lot of good hardware under the hood just to make it look bad cause of a cheap display.<br /><br />I retruned the non-IPS and got this IPS version the next day and love the IPS version of this computer right away and love it. Another point of advice, for some reason the 1 TB Harddrive on both versions are partitioned into 2 x 465 GB partitions which is really annoying since it's 1 physical drive. On the IPS with SSD the OS is on the SSD drive so it was very easy to go into administrative tools, computer management and delete the 2x 465's and re-format to 1 TB partition. This would be very difficult to do on the version without the SSD.<br /><br />I've been using this computer for a couple of weeks, largely gaming and some slight photo/video editing. It performs great in everything I do, I get very high frame rates on almost every game with settings set to max. It's a pretty moderate sized desktop replacement, maybe too big for a commuter computer but great for around the house getting something serious done while sitting on the couch.<br /><br />For those who are looking for the next step down but still a really good deal, take a look at the Lenovo Y50, its regularly on Slick deals for 800-900, it also has IPS and the i7 but its graphics card is the next one down (860M) and it's HDD configuration is 1TB 5400 + 8GB SSD Cache, the SSD Cache will give you a little boost to boot times but the 5400prm speed the HDD will become painful for anything using a lot of data. I was willing to pay a bit more for the Asus because I'm particular about performance and had the budget to put a little more in.<br /><br />The GL551JW is a great deal, it's close to the same performance as high end gaming laptops for half the price.","14"

Contacted ASUS for a replacement only to be told it would take 5-7 business days to examine the laptop and another 7-14 days for repair if it qualified. I contacted Amazon and was able to get a replacement overnighted to me and in my hands the very next day.  Upon receiving my replacement laptop I had a cluster of about 5-7 stuck pixels (white this time) just to the right of the middle of the screen. Contacted ASUS and got the same story. Amazon did not have any more in stock so I decided to go ahead and return the laptop for a refund.  The short amount of time I spent with the laptop I can tell you the build quality was nice and it ran all games I played on it with minimum of 60fps. Boot time was decent for a 7200 RPM HDD.  Overall I did like the design and quality of the laptop, the displays do not seem up to par and ASUS should work on their quality control.  EDIT 05/26/2015: I decided to try to give ASUS another try and bought the GL551JW-DS74 instead of the DS71 model. I must say the extra $150 for SSD and the IPS display was well worth it. I would have paid an extra $200 just for the IPS display over the TN on the DS71 model.","3"

CUK beat the shipping estimate by three days (I actually had the laptop before the estimated ship date) and it arrived in perfect condition. If it weren't for the stickers on the box I would not have known any upgrades had been done. As for performance, this machine is smoking fast. I'm a photographer, not a gamer, but I still need lots of RAM and GPU for what I do and this fits the bill. I opened up six of my largest Photoshop images simultaneously - something I think would actually have killed my last laptop - and this beast just smiled at me and asked for something hard. With the SSD loading apps like Lightroom and Photoshop is nearly instant, and with 2TB of storage I don't need to worry about where I'm going to save things. I'm not thrilled with the location of the USB ports on the right had side of the unit (I'd like them more towards the back) but as far as performance goes I couldn't be happier.","11"

I have 50 Mbps to our modem and no one in the house has had a problem with connectivity except my son.  That means that out of five laptops, three tablets and six cell phones only his laptop has issues with connectivity.  We have had to buy a hard wired signal booster that plugs into the electrical socket where he uses it so that he doesn't face these constant lags.

There are a few problems","This laptop is an incredible machine. I've had it for a few months now and absolutely love it. There are a few problems, all which can be corrected. Maybe ASUS can take a few items of interest from this post and newer models that get built can have these changes fixed, so the end-user doesn't have to deal with the stresses.<br /><br />Pros<br />* Incredible power and graphics<br />* With the correct bag (ASUS ROG Nomad Backpack) this becomes a very potent mobile system. (It is a giant 17.3 inch laptop and not many bags are designed for these monsters)<br />* A company that actually cares about cord management, I've never seen someone send custom cord wraps for the power supply unit. Yes you can buy them but the level of care and detail that went into this machine I cannot match with any other company I have previously bought from (e.g. Alienware, MSI, etc.)<br /><br />Cons<br />* ASUS supposedly has issues with the BIOS and the usb 3.0 components, basically occasionally on boot the system freezes on a black screen and doesn't continue on to the bios. Sometimes it will get past this but it will than proceed to freeze a little after you login. After one boot system is fine and the issue is gone. Well this supposedly has to do (according to research across the interwebs) that ASUS has trouble with usb 3.0 drivers and their bios firmware. However one of the BIOS versions is claimed to not have that issue.<br /><br />Now some will have to upgrade the bios from 202 to 205 but since 206 is the latest some may have to downgrade. (Please grab BIOS 205 and the WinFlash BIOS utility)<br /><br />Drivers / Tools - http://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/ASUS_ROG_G751JY/HelpDesk_Download/<br /><br />(to downgrade the bios -&#62; inside of the WinFlash folder hold &#34;Shift + Right Click&#34; and select open command prompt here -&#62; once the command prompt is open type &#34;WinFlash /nodate&#34; with no quotes and the WinFlash utility will instead just warn that the firmware you are installing is a lower version than the currently installed one))<br /><br />* The final con was a slight lag in-game when using WiFi and this is due to the software installed by ASUS called &#34;ROG First Game III&#34; - this software essentially is a Quality of Service analyser for your internet traffic and on WiFi it seems to just cause bad packet loss which leads to lagging unbearably within game - you have two options (a) disable the software from within the program itself - requires a few setting clicks, but once turned off the QoS will cease to cause lag. Or you have option (b) Completely remove the utility using your &#34;Add or remove programs&#34; feature in Windows.<br /><br />While the con's were a bit weird and stressful to deal with at first. One thing to note is that users do NOT need to just send the laptop back in which dealing with most support your going get long wait times and sometimes you won't get what you expected back. This should save a lot of users the difficulty of getting this system to run out-of-the-box clean and brand new like with no hiccups.","6"

Here is the weird part for those who didn't notice - Alienware charges Sales Tax (laptop value $1900+), Amazon charges Sales Tax (laptop value $1,800+), TigerDirect does not...and TigerDirect through Amazon also didn't charge (laptop value a few dollars over $1,600). All you miss out on is the Witcher 3 game which comes free when ordering from Alienware website.<br /><br />Product Review<br />I am not a very technical person, so all the talk of cpu and clock speed and all is mostly lost on me. I bought this latest spec so I can keep it for 3-4 years without losing out on the performance side...though the way technology is going, I probably will need something new in 2-years.<br /><br />Weight - heavy....I mean really heavy. I never thought I would be so glad to pick up my old Sony Vaio 14-in 4 pound laptop but I am. Despite that, this will become my primary laptop in the next 3-4 days and I will be traveling regularly with it.<br /><br />Resolution - pretty darn good. Unfortunately, when i turn the resolution to 16:9, i do not have the option to make icons any smaller, so they are really huge. Most movies and TV shows start showing pixels even for some 1080p movies.<br /><br />Space -  I have a 128 GB SSD & 1TB HDD...keeping most of my installations to the HDD though. And I think about 30 GB or so of the SSD might already be blocked off for system recovery.<br /><br />Performance - Fast. I just went from a 2 minute windows startup time on my old Vaio to less than 30 secs on this one...and that's after installing iTunes and Norton and all kinds of crap that runs with startup. Another difference, I could install a game like Assassin's Creed on my laptop in about 7-8 minutes. On the Alienware, I installed AC 1-2-3 all in parallel in about 4 minutes.<br /><br />Product Installations - So far I've not run into any issues. It came pre-installed with Office 2013 trial. I never uninstalled it, and yet got no issues when installing my Office 2010. Canon MP495 printer and all my previous Seagate drives ran perfectly fine with no special adjustments.<br /><br />Gaming - In the two days, I managed to install and play...albeit for short times...Dragon Age Inquisition, Mass Effect II, Assassin's Creed Black Flag & Unity, Anno 2070 & Football Manager 2015. Gaming has been great so far. All in all probably about 8 hours of gaming and I didn't hear the laptop fan go into overdrive due to heating or any difference in performance in the entire duration.<br /><br />So if its all that good, why the 4-stars???<br />USB Ports Issue - There are 2 USB ports on each side. On the left side, I plug in the mouse and it works fine. I plug in anything else on the 2nd port on left side, and the 1st one stops working....no idea why. No such issues on the right side...phew!!<br /><br />Sound - Speakers are front facing. While the sound quality is really good for laptop speakers, the volume itself is not the best. Even after maxing out, the volume wasn't all that loud.<br /><br />Lights - An Alienware hallmark, but really annoying. Default setting on my laptop was all lights lit up blue...but I have pared it down to the power button and keyboard backlight only. And having the mouse-pad lit up too, that I think is an overkill.","2"

Second, for my machine (Alienware 13, 2014 version) the printed letters are in some cases printed incorrectly (the Function keys for volume, for example, are on the WRONG keys, so when I go to adjust the volume, I bring up my screen properties instead). The lack of translucency is hard to understand, given the nature of the keyboard the cover is fitted for.

The computer is also very easy to upgrade as I added RAM and another SSD just to hold games.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Updated CPU to 4720<br />IPS display<br />Can easily switch GPU to integrated or the GTX 980M (Integrated GPU gets you a battery life of about 4 to 5 hours)<br />Keyboard is easily customized for color / light display<br />Gaming is smooth on modern games<br />Cooling / Ventilation<br />CPU makes working so much easier as it handle all the things that I run on it<br />GPU upgradeable function<br />WIndows 10 upgrade ready (will not do it though for a few years)<br />Best laptop speakers I've heard in quite some time<br />Dyna Audio software makes music and games sound amazing<br />MSI Logos light up on cover<br />Boots up in less than ten seconds (BIOS loads up in 3.1 seconds)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Trackpad is horrible as there are no borders to let you know where it ends (gesture is off automatically so enable it for scrolling and other features)<br />Third party software pre-installed (easy fix; got rid of all apps and software that I will not ever use)<br /><br />Other notes:<br />There is a void sticker on the bottom vent if you wanted to check out the hardware on your laptop claiming that you will void the warranty should you remove or tamper with it. This is a problem was it is on top of one of the screws. I called MSI and verified this. It is okay to mess with the sticker and it will not void your warranty if you are adding memory or RAM. However, if you remove what is already installed then you will void your warranty.<br /><br />The recovery OS is on the 1 TB hard drive so make sure if you want to replace it with an SSD that you make your recovery disks first.<br /><br />If you want to upgrade to a m.2 SSD I bought and installed Kingston Digital 240GB SSDNow M.2 SATA (6Gbps) Compact Form Factor SSD 3.5-Inch SM2280S3/240GB through Amazon.<br /><br />If you want to grade your RAM I bought and installed Kingston Technology 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L (PC3-12800) 1.35V Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Intel Laptop Memory KVR16LS11/8 through Amazon.<br /><br />Update: 9June2015<br />I might have to change my reviews on this laptop. For starters, after a week's use, the laptop will boot or restart into a black screen. The last time this happened was on June 8th. I called up MSI and they think that it might because I was on battery mode trying to boot up with two USB devices plugged in (wireless keyboard / mouse combo and my external HD). The only item I have plugged in now is my wireless keyboard / mouse combo and so far today I haven't had a black screen hang. MSI also recommended that I update the BIOS and update the drivers from their website. I've contacted Amazon customer service and they have been very helpful on their part where they are willing to exchange for the same item or a different item while I keep using this one and offer to ship the exchanged item at the same shipping seed (for me it was 1 day shipping). I am hoping that I will not have to return this device due to screen problem, but I will wait a few more days to see if I have any issues and will update this post then. Hopefully, it was just needed to update the BIOS and drivers. However, I should not have any problems from the beginning like this. It is not Amazon's fault, but rather MSI.<br /><br />Update: 16June2015<br />As mentioned before, I was having a boot problem during shutdown / startup where the screen would remain black and updating the drivers / BIOS / firmware did not work whatsoever. I ended up having to return the laptop back to Amazon. The great thing about Amazon's customer service is that they shipped me a replacement on the 12th of June via next day shipping for no charge. So far, I've only experienced the hanging issue with this laptop once and I think it is because Windows Explorer decide to hang and freeze the laptop. I hope that I wont have anymore issues and if I do, I will permanently replacing this laptop and just go with the Asus ROG model which only has the 4GB version of the GTX 980M. Thank you Amazon for the customer service; you're awesome!","6"

So far so good.<br />-Good keyboard. Im not too anal about it, but it's pretty nice, especially with the different color scheme across the board.<br />-fast. Definitely faster than my 3 yr old desktop, and windows 8.1 is pretty intuitive. I have to qualms about it.<br />- Not too much junk in it. Only Norton, but still doesnt ruin it for me.<br />-fingerprint is an issue, but only if you expect your laptop to NEVER have any prints on it. I am ok with it, and was expecting it. Doesn't ruin functionality, more aesthetically.<br />-haven't had a chance to try out the video card since I am still in the middle of the Origin download for BF4.<br />-touchy wifi card. I have decent internet connection but it fluctuates between the highest possible download rate to 25%. My gf is sitting next to me with her mac and it's not as bad.<br />-quite. Im probably not a good judge of this since I am not anal about these things, but i dont have an issue with the fan.<br /><br />I like it. Then again, as long as it does what it's supposed to do, I really dont care about anything else.","5"

I'm a professional day trader and will use this as my mobile trading station since the market is often very slow during the summer and I don't want to be pinned down at home.<br /><br />So here's what I can say.<br /><br />The PROS's:<br /><br />1. Package arrived on time and everything worked perfectly out of the box.<br />2. Minimal bloatware that was easily removed.<br />3. The quality of construction was much better than expected. Very study feeling.<br />4. LOVE the keyboard. Keys easy to identify and it just feels good.<br />5. The IPS monitor is great. The viewing angle is extremely wide.<br />6. For what I do this thing runs ice cold. That's with running 4 trading platforms, charting software(killed my old i3 HP laptop), chatrooms, AIM, and Chrome with about 6-7 tabs open. WIth all that going on my old i3 would start to get very hot and slow. This beast doesn't even break a sweat.<br />7. FAST! My desktop is a i7 4790K with 32gb ram and Samsung EVO PRO ssd. I cant really tell much difference. My charting software took 3 minutes to load on the old i3, about 15 sec on this thing. About the same as my desktop. Boot times are really quick too. Think seconds.<br />8. The ISP screen allows such hi resolution that I can fit quite a bit more on the same sized screen. I wasn't expecting that so that was a nice positive surprise. Fwiw, I'm 54 and my eyes are not that good. I'm shocked I can read the small font but it's just so very clear/tight and vivid that its actually no problem.<br />9.It's quiet. So far more quiet than my old laptop was even just web browsing.<br />10. The track pad isn't bad at all. I'm not sure if I got lucky or if everyone else is just used to something better than I've ever had, but this track pad beats the crap out of the HP Probook I have.<br />11. The wifi card seems awesome. My router is in the basementof our house(no windows). I can sit in my driveway and still get a strong signal. The HP can't do that.<br />12. It's light. Very light. Probably weighs no more than my HP but the weight is better distributed. I can easily walk around carrying this with 1 hand with the display open. I thought it would be a little heavier.<br /><br />Cons: (being really nit picky here)<br /><br />1. It's a finger print/dust magnet. Doesn't matter to me as this is a work machine not a trophy.<br />2. I think it's storing temp files to the ssd drive thus taking up space.My desktop does that too and I just delete them once in a while, but for some reason I can't figure out how to do that on this machine yet. Both run WIn 8.1 too so that's odd. I probably figure that out in time, or maybe someone here will tell me how:)<br />3. The sound isn't very good. Really lacks bass. Doesn't matter to me but may for some.<br />4  I think the colors are off. Reds sort of look like neon. I can probably adjust that just haven't taken the time. Any suggestions?<br /><br />Anyway, for what i bought this laptop for, I think I'm going to be very happy. I'll likely never experience the GTX 960M card, but I love the overall speed and feel of this computer.","3"

Does everything you need it to do as far as handling gaming goes on the highest settings. There are a few tweaks to it that in settings if you turn them on there performance does drop off a bit but without those its perfect and gets over 80-140 fps which is really really good. Its not a perfect laptop but not to be expected if you are only paying $800 for it. But its gonna handle what you need it too for the purchase of. Gaming, video editing and all things of that nature it will do with no problem and some extra power options that gives you a bit more battery life than I thought I could have. So yea. No complaints from me on my purchase.","2"

Physically, it is lightweight and somewhat portable. The real test though, is wether this laptop can truly claim to be a gaming laptop, due to its low price. The answer is yes, as long as you recognize that most games will not run on ultra high graphics. I run skyrim, mass effect 1-3, fallout NV on mid-high graphics, with mods on skyrim and fallout. No lag at all. DayZ is a bit more CPU intensive, and I have to run it on low. Even then it runs at only 45-60 fps, though this is still very playable. It should be noted that the processer is described as 3.5 Ghz. Although it can boost up to that speed, its base Ghz is actually 2.9. It is still a lightning fast computer that can run most any game, so long as you dont expect to be running them at top graphics. All in all, it is probably the best quality and fastest laptop you can buy for under $1000, and is easily faster than many of its $1200+ counterparts. Highly recommend!","4"

I'm not a gamer, but I need good specs because I'm a researcher and run a lot of powerful software. The price is amazing for the specs this computer contains.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I dislike about it is that there's no &#34;end&#34; key, except when numlock is off.  I use the end, home, pgup and pgdn keys constantly, and I use the numpad regularly, so this was a super annoying little detail. To fix it, I ended up remapping the context menu key (between the right-hand alt and ctrl keys) to be an end key instead. It's a little awkward to have it there, and I do occasionally miss the context menu key, but it's worth it for me.<br /><br />That, and like many people, I dislike windows 8. I recommend getting the classic start menu back :)","0"

The only problem i had was with the F9 entry into the Restore and Repair features. When you try to boot up using F9 its removes the boot record and MBR so you have to Boot from CD image and use command prompts to restore them in order to boot up. This did however allow me to get into the Restore so i could make a USB stick that would allow me to restore back to factory image.<br /><br />The machine itself is a BEAST and is actually a little better then the desktop i built for gaming last year. I dont do much gaming any more but i do use it for CAD which has been running wonderfully on this machine. I wish it had windows 7 on it so that more of my software wasn't such a pain to install but with a little effort i was able to get everything working.<br /><br />Overall this has been a Great purchase from a great company.I would recommend the Computer Upgrade Kings for any online computer purchase.","7"

The order was shipped quickly and well packed. Can't find a single thing to complain about thus far!  ETA: This thing had the worst touchpad I've ever used. Overly sensitive and either the buttons need to be separate from the touchpad or touch to click needs to be turned off. Also the Ethernet port is terrible. You have to push small lever and then push down on it to plug in a cable. It's cumbersome and unnecessary. A full rj-45 port wouldn't detract from the sleek design of the case all that much. With tech, form is nice but function is king. Aside from that, it's great... Just invest in a mouse to use with it.","0"

This has not affected anything I've needed to use the laptop for yet.<br /><br />This laptop boots up very fast.  (My Dell laptop takes way longer and also has a solid state drive).  I am able to play some online games with very good frame rates where I had constant crashes/video card issues with my Dell.  (I am not anti-Dell, just had too many issues with my L502X from the time I first received it).  Thus far, everything has been running smoothly with this Asus.  The speaker sound is okay without headphones.  With headphones on, I feel the sound is better.  The cooling system is very quiet!  When doing &#34;regular&#34; stuff, I hear nothing at all.  When playing a game, you will hear the fan running, but for me, it seems quiet compared to the other two laptops in our house (Dell and Apple).  It gets warm after lengthy or high-use gaming on the left hand side of the keyboard, but this is not unlike other laptops and it does not get as hot as the Dell or Apple in our house.<br /><br />One improvement this laptop could have used is a better screen.  This one has to be tilted at just the right angle to get the best view, otherwise, some colors are faded/washed out which can make some object margins difficult to discern.  I'm up in the air on the port placement since there are pluses and minuses to side vs. rear ports.<br /><br />So far, this laptop has won me over.

It is massive, and can be loud at the higher speeds, but these are merely side effects of the sheer power of the thing. My wife's laptop would run hot enough that she could not touch certain parts of it, and this beast can tame the computer down to completely normal levels of heat without even being on the highest setting. Also, it is incredibly well- constructed; it can take a beating like a champ. In its years of use and abuse, the clear plastic covers have almost all been knocked out (but never cracked or broken, so we could replace them), the fans themselves have eventually been knocked loose and will slide around in the housing when carried, and it still works at peak efficiency like we bought it yesterday. Due to the rubber ends, it still looks like new, with nary a scratch on it. This is far and away the best cooling pad I have ever bought.","0"

"B00UOYQ0YW","ASUS G501JW 15-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","4","2015-07-13","Great Gaming Laptop Under $1700","I purchased this laptop as an upgrade from my Asus ROG G75VW-AH71 which was a larger (17.3 in screen), heavier (almost 9 lbs with a large power brick), and older (about 3 years old) system.  I had a great experience with this laptop but noticed that some of the newer games weren't able to run very well (Shadows of Mordor, The Witcher 3).<br /><br />After comparison on various sites, I found that this laptop packed the most features (at least the ones I was looking for) for the price (I paid $1,689).  Other laptops around this price point offered maybe a better graphics card but with a much smaller SSD or a better graphics card but with less ram.  When I weighed out my options, this seemed to me the logical choice.<br /><br />PROS:  First, although I didn't see it mentioned on the Amazon site, this did come with a ROG gaming mouse and headset.  This was a nice surprise to me.  Next, I immediately fell in love with the size and weight of the laptop.  Many people have been critical of it's simple design but to me it looks great.  it's less than an inch thick and less than half the weight of my previous laptop.  Even the power brick was smaller.  The SSD booted up the OS (Windows 8.1) lightening quick and it was already split into two drives (one for the OS and one for Data).  Another feature that has caught a lot of negative feedback is the 4k screen.  Even when I was looking at features between other makes and models, I was hard pressed to find another laptop with comparable features even if it didn't come with a 4k screen.  To me, the quality of the screen (even if not used for 4k gaming) is beautiful.  Finally, while I wish the laptop came with a 965m or 970m, the 960m graphics card gets the job done.  Having been burned by a recent purchase of an MSI product, i wanted to return to Asus due to the great experience I've had with my older laptop.  I could have gone with an off brand and gotten a better graphics card for the same or even less money, but there is value in certain brands and Asus is one of those brands for me.<br /><br />CONS: the laptop is not a complete slam dunk.  I would say my biggest concern/complain is the ventilation.  NOTE: I have not had the computer overheat or have performance issues.  However, the vents are placed on the back edge of the laptop and the screen, when opened, overlaps the vents causing the hot air to blow directly down on your lap.  The laptop runs very cool if you are browsing the web or running basic programs, but when the GPU ramps up, the hot air really starts to flow.  I would agree with other reviewers that the finish on the laptop is very smudge prone but that is not a deal breaker.  I would also agree that the speakers aren't great but considering the size of the laptop, this is not shocking or a deal breaker.  Also, the free gaming headset more than made up for that to me.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great laptop for gaming.  It sounds to me that the price point when this came out was a bit higher at which point I would have agreed that the cost was too high.  But, for the price that I paid, I am very satisfied with the features and performance I am getting.in certain brands and Asus is one of those brands for me.<br /><br />CONS: the laptop is not a complete slam dunk.

Best value for money.<br /><br />I've had my old Asus laptop for 6 years. Being a cheapstake, I couldn't get myself to buy a new laptop until the old one died. The old one is still alive (that's the primary reason I bought an Asus) but upon seeing this beauty, I couldn't get myself not to buy it.<br /><br />Most games automatically put you in ultra-high settings although I usually adjust to high settings for better FPS. (playing GTA5, Witcher 3, AC Rogue, MGS5, Dark Souls 3, Fallout 3 and a couple of online RPGs)<br /><br />One quirk though is that it doesn't have a dedicated &#34;end&#34; button. Other than that, I have no qualms with this product. Matte screen is awesome especially if you do a lot of outside work because the reflection of the sun will not bother you. Speakers is ok, no problem with it. Laptop fits nicely in backpacks. I was surprised that it is not &#34;that&#34; heavy (as a 100lbs girl this means a lot). Keys are great, I'm used to Asus' keyboard configuration and feel. The red backlit gives the laptop that special bad boy look. Numkey pad is perfect for me, it is kinda thin but i have small finger so that's ok with me. It's a great plus since I am an analyst and use my own laptop to work.<br /><br />Overall it is a 5-star laptop and for the price, you couldn't get anything better. I'll update if I find any problems.","0"

I got it at my door three days ago and have been running it through it's paces ever since. So far I have very very little to complain about and a lot that I absolutely love about this computer.<br /><br />We'll start out with the only part I don't like about it. That is the trackpad. It is slightly grainy due to the texture. It has lines going vertically that make it a little annoying when you first use it. Like I said, I have had this for three days and have already gotten used to it.<br /><br />Now for the neutral points.<br />-Larger in size than your average laptop, but this is a gaming laptop. So it's regular sized for that. This size comparison is coming from a 17.3 Toshiba Satellite. It's about half an inch larger in thickness.<br />-The button layout is different than a normal keyboard. The only thing that's harder to get used to is the arrow keys being so close together with everything else around it.<br />-The finish on the laptop does get dirty fast, so expect that. Plus to that is that it does clean extremely easy.<br />-The usb 3.0 ports on the left hand side are slightly close together. Only becomes an issue if you have larger usb cables. Only had a problem when connecting my ridiculously over sized hard drive cables.<br /><br />And now for the awesome parts.<br />-First thing you notice about it is the keyboard. I was between this model and the model right below it but the keyboard was the deciding factor. The keys feel superb when you depress them and look awesome.<br />-The sound.... Lets just say these speakers pack a bigger punch than my Phillips tv while keeping the sound clarity.<br />-USB ports everywhere. Four in total they come in handy in ways I never thought possible.<br />-As stated before the finish on this computer is hard to keep clean, but I love the brushed metal finish.<br />-Manually controlled fan is awesome for keeping everything extra cool.<br />-Screen resolutionis epic, even in comparison to the new mac retina pro.<br />-Windows 8.1 is a bummer but the layout is easily changed and you get windows ten for free if you want it.<br /><br />Overall I have no regrets about this laptop. Even if the price went down right after I purchased this I still feel as though I got a lot of computer for the price I payed. If you are looking for a pretty good gaming laptop or just an excellent running laptop in general this is a great choice. I hardly ever write reviews this long on products but this one truly deserved it.","43"

I wanted to use the power supply that came with the laptop for travel (it's smaller) and leave this one at home in a semi-permanent location.  For about 5 months it worked perfectly, but now when I plug it into the ASUS laptop it charges for a few minutes, and then the green light goes off on the power supply and it fails to continue charging. The OEM power supply that was shipped with the laptop does not exhibit the same behavior.  As with another review on this product, I'll note that the power supply is significantly larger than the OEM one, which is fine if you're not going to bring it on travel and just leave it at home. It has a straight connector, which is also fine, since I find that the 90 degree bend connector in the ASUS OEM power supply constantly falls out of the socket on the laptop. However, I'll also note that this power supply is shipped with a short adapter cord so that it can be used with the ASUS ROG G751JY, and it's easy to accidentally disconnect the adapter cord from the end of the power supply cord. This is not ideal.  If it were just the size and adapter issues, I'd give this product 4 stars. But since it failed only in a few months, I'm giving it 1 star. I would have bought a second OEM power supply, but there didn't seem to be any available anywhere.  Update: 2015/07/26  The vendor did reply promptly to my request to return the power supply. However, since it failed after 2 months, it can't be returned or exchanged. For those looking to purchase from this particular vendor, here is some useful information about their return and warranty service that you should be aware of before purchasing from them.  &#34;Our policy is: 1 years warranty, 7 days money back, 1 month exchange unconditional, after 2 month repair service. For your order,  We will offer repair service for you, it may take about 45 days. Or,to save your time money,I will send you a replacement without returning ,but you need pay $29.99 Excluding shipping.&#34;  So, in short... I can pay to ship it to them (it's heavy so it won't be cheap to ship) and they will have it for 45 days to repair it. Or, I can purchase a new one and they'll charge me $29.99 + shipping (which would probably end up being 50% of the original cost of the unit taking shipping into account)  It looks like the best method here is to treat this purchase and vendor as sunk cost and instead just purchase a completely new OEM power supply. At the time that I made this original purchase, ASUS didn't sell one, but now they do.","2"

"B00UOYQ0YW","ASUS G501JW 15-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","2","2015-07-27","Great for university/college students! -- See updates at the end for reasons behind 2 starts...","Recommendation: -Buy this laptop if you are a college student. (See reasons below) -If you aren't going to be carrying this laptop around that much, I would recommend going with a g551 instead (See reasons below)  At first I was quite hesitant to buy this laptop, I had seen mixed reviews concerning the lack of support for 4k as well as those who say that 4k &#34;isn't worth the price tag&#34; at this point in time and I almost decided to go with a cheaper laptop with a gtx 970m vs the quite weak gtx 960m in this laptop.  Looking back on my prior worries now that I own the laptop, I can now say for certain a few things that other reviewers (who are mainly focused on gaming) and other youtube parties might disagree with.  Pros: -4k is definitely worth it, I have no eye strain after looking at this laptop for hours and the super nice and crisp background never fails to put a smile on my face every day -512 gb Pci-E SSD is not fast, but INSANELY FAST.  The laptop starts up within 5-10 seconds, about the same time it takes to wake up from sleep mode, which is ludicrously fast.  As a college student, this is great as I can shut down my laptop in between classes to conserve battery and start it right back up in time for my next class later in the day or if I want to study at the library. -Form factor is beautiful, the sleek black brushed aluminum doesn't only look good, but adds incredible stability and integrity to the case, allowing for minimal amounts of frame bending and a solid feel to the laptop.  On top of this, the laptop is very light (because of the aluminum) and is great to carry around (no back strain whatsoever). -Fan noise is amazingly quiet; Its quieter than most ultrabooks and even other laptops out on the market.  It's perfect for a library environment or a class environment. This laptop guarantees that your laptop will not be the loudest most annoying laptop in the library or during class.  Cons: -Laptop's gtx 960m is a little low on power if you are looking to play new 2015 titles such as shadow of mordor and similar games, HOWEVER, league of legends, tf2 and cs: go run flawlessly at the native 4k resolution, some even at maximum graphics settings. -The color scheme is showy and attracts a LOT of attention (this could also be a plus if you wanna show off your new baby but I myself prefer keeping a lower profile)  Conclusion: The Asus g501jw is a great laptop for a college student (or freshly graduated senior who is about to go to college).  Its 4k screen is bright and has great colors, it is lightweight, and the SSD is amazing.  To anyone who would be traveling with this laptop a lot, I would definitely recommend it.  If you are most likely going to leave this laptop at home, I would recommend going with a different option as this laptop's hefty price tag of $1600 is a result of the beautiful, light form factor which makes it more of a mainstream ultrabook type laptop which still packs some power to its punch.  EDIT: Had to return the laptop after a month of use as the trackpad popped out of its socket, build quality may not be up to spec so I detracted 2 stars from my original rating... If I buy a $1600 laptop I expect that the trackpad doesn't pop out after 1 month of use :(.  EDIT 2: Got my return laptop and instantly noticed something inside was blocking the fan, had to return that one as well as once I opened it up, I realized there was a note blocking the fan which said, and I quote &#34;Keyboard is broken and not working correctly&#34; in traditional Chinese.  Not only did I see this as bad but unreasonable for such a large company to have basically no QA as to even start the laptop out and listen for such a note which would block the fans.  In total I decided to go with a refurbished Razer Blade 2014 and I LOVE it, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a RELIABLE laptop rather than gambling on if they would get one of these which work well or come with a note saying that it is brokeninside.","33"

My brother was always the comp geek, and never quite got around to teaching me, and I never quite got around to teaching myself like I wanted to. So, this review might be more for the gamer who is thinking about either making a move from console to laptop/PC gaming or adding that to their repertoire as opposed to your seasoned PC gamer who knows their stuff about computers (I'll learn, I swear!). I have a friend who bought this computer and she said she loved it (and she knows more than I do about specs), so I bought it after she had hers for 6 months. Now, while I don't know specifics on specs and what not (basics on RAM and the like), I know when a computer is running fast and when graphics are beautiful and smooth because I've worked and played enough on different laptops. Now, can I compare it to other gaming laptops? Only Asus since that was my gaming laptop gateway and mine was an out of date second-hand machine too, the model of which I can't even remember, which I ended up burning out playing a game that wasn't even on high setting. So, I can't compare it to high models of Asus, but compared to the one I had, which was about over 7 years old from this year in any case, so comparison is a bit out of date in any case. For me, this MSI model is a good re entry into the world of PC gaming and computers as a whole.<br /><br />This laptop is great for work or play, but to be honest, if you're just going to use it for work (unless that work is something related to graphic design maybe) it's a waste. This was meant for play, and it plays well. The graphics on games like Borderlands 2 and Dragon Age Inquisition (my two games of choice at moment) are fantastic and I haven't had any problems with crashes even when I ran DA:I at high setting for everything. The Dragon Gaming software is pretty neat to keep track of speed and heat of comp and you can customize graphic settings or so on with other software too. I would suggest an external fan if you're going to run games on high settings, however, since it can run a little hot, and while the internal fan it comes with is pretty darn good, it's kind of loud and doesn't quite work to keep it that cool when I'm running certain games (I'm a bit rough with my stuff though...it's terrible, I know). I find an added external fan works really well to keep it cooler while running those high settings.<br /><br />The only thing not up to snuff for me is the built-in webcam. It's very grainy and pixelated, and I was expecting something a little better than that for this kind of a computer. My webcam on my Toshiba that's over 15 years old (I call it my dinky backup baby) is better than this one, and that's saying something. But, it works overall if you just want to chat with friends over Skype, I guess. If you're thinking about gamecasting though where you have your face showing, I'd suggest an external HD webcam (I use a logitech HD webcam and it's crisp and works fantastic). The screen quality as a whole on this model is good. And the 17.3 inch screen?! Apparently, I was doing this all wrong with my tiny screened laptops because it's like a whole new world for me, and there are other models and brands with even larger screens. Sound on the laptop itself is very good for me, and even with a headset is good, clean sound. I love the blu-ray DVD player too. My favorite feature, however, is a shallow one and totally cosmetic, but the led back-lit keyboard is awesomely amusing! The software it comes with is easy for anyone to use and customize up to four different color settings (you better believe I have a Christmas theme one!). I have a special setting that lights up only certain keys I use for certain games and then my basic work setting. I can't believe that's what I would enjoy most out of a gaming laptop, but I sure as hell do.<br /><br />While it's a laptop, don't be fooled,this is not your ordinary kind of laptop and I would warn you against lugging it around often. Doesn't mean never, but from what I've seen from myself, it's not a computer you want to take with you if you travel several days within a week where it sits in the car for several hours (I live about 2 hours from my school and would take it...totally for work, umm, totally). If you travel a lot and need to take it with you on the go, however, invest in a good laptop case. I've seen good ones by Alienware and I have a Solo Urban pack, which works fine because I wasn't going too far anywhere, nor driving more than twice a week, but if I were, I'd have gone with a more expensive brand like Alienware that has more prominent padding and shell-like casing bags - they also have great TSA approved bags now that you just zip open and don't have to pull the laptop out. And if you do put in your bag, always shut the laptop down, even if you're just heading from your house to coffee shop. If you put it in sleep mode and don't pay attention to processes running in background, the laptop can turn on and that can be nightmarish if it's running in a small space leading to possible overheating (no, I totally did not do this once, what are you talking about? Did you not get that I'm a bit of a noob and only now really learning? Yes, it's okay, I embrace the status, I will grow from it, and I write this for any other nooblets themselves moving up in their gaming computer world).<br /><br />One big warning: after 6 months, my computer started acting up where it would boot up but then shut right back down. It would do that several times before booting up. After about a week of that it just stopped starting back up at all and wouldn't turn on. At first I thought it was an error because of a Windows Update, but after the problem persisted with a system restore to point before the whole update, I knew it was something more. Some digging online led me to find that other people with this model reported the same or similar problem roughly 6 months after use. However, Computer King Upgrade was excellent in helping me and after I tried to go in to the laptop myself with not being able to fix the problem, they took over. They determined it was a hardware problem and it got shipped back to MSI who fixed the problem in about 3 weeks with no issues, and that's where I'm at right now having had my laptop back for two weeks, and running even better than before.<br /><br />All in all, for my first &#34;real&#34; gaming laptop, I enjoy it for the level of gaming I'm at right now. While I was upset about the hardware issue, especially this having been the most expensive computer I've ever bought as of yet, which was scary for me, stuff happens, but the way it was handled was excellent from both seller and manufacturer, which is why this is a 4. Now, I'm already looking forward to adding upgrades and playing around more and learning about computers to eventually building my own gaming PC.","1"

The old G750 is tough on the road and works great with the Thunderbolt monitor on my desk. The old G750 also does 120mbps down from the Internet over my office wifi, not to mention Gbps local transfer rates, and also works great with every wifi hub I have connected to while travelling.<br /><br />In contrast, this new G751 fails to function with my Thunderbolt monitor at all and provides miserable wifi performance. Plug the monitor into the G750, perfection, plug the monitor into the new G751 and in makes the dreaded Windows connecting and disconnection noise over and over and over.<br /><br />Also this G751 fails to connect to the exact same WIFI hub that the old G750 works perfectly on (even with what should be totally unnecessary hub tweaking). The heart of the problem as far as I can tell is the old G750 contains a Broadcomm wireless AC card and the G751 contains the much maligned Intel 7260NGW (volumes of complaints in the Intel/Asus and other forums). Updated drivers, etc. nothing worked. The best the G751 can do is 50mbps on 2.4 GHz down from the internet (less than half the number the old G750 posts). The worst part is that this is also the limit for it on local transfers! Dog slow.<br /><br />I have literally had the two laptops sitting right next to each other to demonstrate the perfect operation of the old G750 and the complete failure of the new G751. Asus was nonplussed. I have sent the lap top back to Asus twice now. The first time they sent it back it was no different than when I sent it in as far as I could tell. Perhaps they brainlessly swapped out some boards which worked the same as the ones they removed. Hard to tell.  I am approaching the 6 month mark and still have no laptop after shelling our $3K for this guy.<br /><br />Sosad, it is an awesome laptop otherwise. Very fast, sturdier feel than the older one. If you didn't have to deal with Asus, could actually plug in a Tbolt monitor and get the thing to connect to a 5GHz hub it would be untouchable. As it is, for me it is a waste of 3K.","1"

My requirements were simple - I had to have the beefiest computer I could buy for under 3k.  I had specced out engineering and scientific purposed laptops suitable for processing large amounts of data but at the end of the day I chose the ASUS ROG751 because 1)  I wanted (needed? lol) bleeding edge everything under 3k 2) the cooling system was important to me.  i plan on occasionally over clocking this beast. 4) I wanted expansive storage but most especially a large internal SSD drive.  The way mine is configured BTW the OS sits on the SSD - sweet.  5) I needed a backlit keyboard for when I'm working with other computer geeks late at night on the other side of the world  6) had to be portable  7) dual monitor was also important.  I would have preferred an additional HDMI output, but really that's not a complaint.  This thing is maxed out on USB ports.  1 standard VGA port and 1 HDMI port are what I use to triple screen this bad boy.<br /><br />The response time on this thing is ridiculous.  Rebooting typically takes under 30 seconds unless there is an update of some sort.  The game dashboards, etc for monitoring your memory use I find useful when I've got a zillion instances of chrome, my IDE's, Photoshop, test apps running, etc.  Image and video editing on this thing are really smooth (adobe creative suite).<br /><br />Not a complaint but just be aware: this beast is heavy.  I knew that from other reviews but really it doesn't hit you until you are taking it out of the really slick ASUS box it comes in when new.  Frankly I think they included a battery just so they ASUS could claim it's a laptop.  LOL.  I don't really care about that I'm always plugged in anyway no matter where I'm at.  If you are putting it through it's paces don't count on the battery to do anything but very briefly stave off the inevitable.<br /><br />Adivce: Purchase an extra cooling pad and a really good case.  It's heavy!  Also wash your hands constantly - the natural oils in your hands do show up on the matte finish of the case and keys.  I use off the shelf electronic wipes to clean it.hands constantly - the natural oils in your hands do show up on the matte finish of the case and keys.

After telling them the monitor is pink during bios settings, they seemed very helpful and suggested my issue is covered by warranty.  Within 20 minutes, I now have a support case # and an address to send the laptop to.  **Update_02  Customer support was solid, I had my laptop back in a week and  a half.  **UPDATE_03 So the track pad is hit and miss now.. sometimes it tracks across the screen in a short finger movement, and sometimes it craws and takes 3 or four swipes to get across.  Frankly it's fairly useless and a mouse is needed.  I barely use this thing and it seems to be decaying at an alarming rate.  If things were working stellar, this would be an excellent piece of kit.

This protector includes an alcohol wipe and microfiber cloth to clean the screen and one of the nicest plastic squeegees I have seen.  It also has a &#34;dust remover&#34;, basically a sticker that you can use to pick up a spec of dust if it adheres to the back of the protector during install.  I wish all manufacturers would include that, it saved me a few bubbles.  Speaking of bubbles, there aren't any, not a single one.  I was amazed.  I cleaned the screen thoroughly and started by removing about 2 inches of the back protective film.  Once I had it aligned I used the squeegee to lay it on the screen.  If I got a bubble, I would lift up the protector a bit and squeegee it out.  This went on so easy, I was surprised.  The other great feature it the front of the screen also has a removable protective film so you don't scratch the screen protector while installing it.  Something the first protector did not have.  Overall, if you take your time, clean your screen well, and be patient you will have a bubble free protector when you are done.  If/when this stars to fail, I will buy another in a heart beat.","0"

I was so satisfied with the Lenovo I planned to get another from the same brand, however I've been hearing about MSI lately and figured I'd give this a try. I wanted a laptop more capable of gaming at high speeds and that is exactly what I got. I play League of Legends at VERY HIGH settings, Remember Me at the highest settings, Guild Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls Online at the highest setting. No lag, no shadowing, no jerky picture. This thing is pretty smooth. Initially I had an issue with audio quality, however MSI support responded back pretty quickly, and after installing new firmware, chipset and audio drivers, the issue was resolved.<br />CONS: I am used to running my OS on an SSD - this laptop has a 7200 rpm platter drive so it takes a bit longer to boot than my last one. Also, the bottom of the unit is one full piece of plastic - so you have to remove the entire bottom (about 15 screws, I think) to install new memory or install a new HDD. Probably not too big of a deal since I'll only do it once or twice the whole time I have it, but I miss those laptops where only one screw kept you from the hard drive. Finally, I have some OS issues, (task bar freezes, for instance) but I think that's more due to the newness of the Windows 10 upgrade than the laptop itself.<br /><br />All-in-all, though, this is a solid upgrade from my tiny Lenovo. The 17.3 inch screen is huge, the colors are brilliant and the mechanical keyboard feels awesome. The included software all seems useful, not like the bloatware that came with my previous laptops. This is a computer designed for gaming and for that purpose it excels. I've only spent a week on it, so I'll update if anything changes but, at this point, I'm extremely satisfied.","16"

It is very fast, boots up in no time, and has a beautifully lit keyboard and brilliant display.<br /><br />The problem is that when Acer built this unit, they forgot that actual human beings are going to use this computer. Let's start with the volume controls. Instead of having separate volume controls, they are part of the &#34;up&#34; and &#34;down&#34; toggle keys, which practically renders them useless.<br /><br />Because unless you are in an actual media application, they do not work. Working online playing music in the background and want to turn the music down? Sorry, you'll have to actually click the volume icon and adjust it with your mouse. No fast way to do it.<br /><br />Same thing with lack of media keys. Running Spotify, etc, in the background while you're working on something else, and want to skip to the next track? Sorry, no keyboard shortcuts here, you actually have to click onto the app and use your mouse to do it. VERY frustrating, and shortsighted on Acer's part.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the Number lock issue. Every single time you either restart, or if the computer goes to sleep (or if the display turns off), caps lock is auto disabled, and I have not found any settings to fix it. So if you're like me and use the number pad a lot, get used to constantly guessing whether caps lock is on or off.<br /><br />Now if Acer had a little bit of horse sense they would (just like most other laptops do) have a small indicator light on the keyboard to let you know whether capslock is on or off. But nope, such luxuries are apparently too good for users of this computer.<br /><br />And let's talk power button. Computer goes to sleep and you want to turn it back on? Good luck finding that power button, as it is as black as the computer is, with NO indicator light, like most other laptops have. Same thing for turning it off, you have to feel your way around to actually find it.<br /><br />If it wasn't for these issues I would have given this laptop 5 stars, but considering how frustrating they are to deal with on a daily basis, all this laptop deserves is 3 stars, and that's on a good day.frustrating they are to deal with on a daily basis, all this laptop deserves is 3 stars, and that's on a good day.","2"

This laptop is what you'd expect from a mid/high end gaming laptop and fits perfectly into its price range of around $1000.  It hasn't had a problem running any game I tossed at it from Pillars of Eternity to the Wither 3 as long as I was reasonable about my expectations on graphics.  This isn't a machine that will run everything on High but unless you're into the top end games as far as graphical power is concerned you'll be fine.  The build id sturdy and the keyboard is great as far as laptop keyboards go.  The backlit key program that comes with it is a nice small addition and offers you tons of options.<br /><br />CONS: The reasons I can't give this laptop 5 stars is due to some basic design flaws that aren't able to be over looked.

It has the same metal feel as the cover and seems unnecessary as if it was just a smooth surface it would have been better. (A small downside if you're willing to have a mouse at all times but not something everyone is willing to deal with).  Finally this thing is a finger print magnet.  As someone who takes very good care of their things you can't avoid smudging this thing everywhere and it's surprisingly difficult to clean.","2"

The price is very good for the performance. However, some huge downsides:<br />-Comes with a s***ton of bloatware from Acer. It took me at least an hour to figure out what to throw away and what to keep. What could I delete without gimping the computer? It's not very clear.<br />-However, I found out the bloatware runs even deeper. Need to upgrade your Intel Drivers? Gotta use the Acer drivers! Drivers which many games don't seem to recognize.<br />-RAM upgradability. You can't upgrade your RAM without a technician apparently. This is a problem for me; I live in Japan so I can't exactly go to Walmart.<br />-Hard disk upgradability. The s***ty hard disk read speeds are the biggest problem with this laptop. I thought I could simply switch out the hard drive for a better one, but this is quite annoying as they don't provide the laptop with a backup OEM Windows CD.<br /><br />The hard disk upgradability is a major concern for me especially because, just a few weeks after using this laptop, I get some random periodic slowdowns. Every 10 minutes or so, there's a 1 second program freeze (including games of course); my guess would be that its trying to access the hard drive but cannot go quickly enough, but it might be some of their integrated bloatware too. r<br /><br />It was pretty hard to find information about any of this. Most websites only review performance (which this laptop is not halfway bad at). But Acer are being dicks with bloatware. It's a real shame in light of things like the amazing quality screen, good performance and good price.","2"

It is also a relatively portable machine. I actually fell in love with it.<br /><br />There are 2 reasons why I returned this product for a full refund.<br /><br />1. I powered on the machine for the first time and noticed smudgy text. With some calibration and scaling, I managed to resolve this issue. However, I could not the resolve issues of strongly restricted viewing angles, very low luminance, uneven luminance distribution, and low contrast levels. These elements had a pronounced effect on my overall experience. In my line of work (i.e., CAE: 3-D solid modelling, mesh generation, etc...), I frequently switch focus from one location on the display to another (e.g., in creating points, curves, in probing for locations of points, etc...). Significantly low luminance and contrast, as well as limited viewing angles called for increased effort in focusing, and constant tilting of the head. I developed headaches, and experienced flashing in my vision as a result of these effects.<br />This is an excellent machine for gamers who play in low-lit surrounding environments, and are on a budget. I do not recommend this machine for operation in a well-lit office environment. I am very disappointed in the display.<br /><br />2. I considered sending the machine in for repair, but was informed by ASUS technical support that displays on this particular machine is considered defective only if there are dead pixels or other notable discontinuities in the form of distinguishable lines.<br /><br />I am very happy from my experience with Portable Guy. They helped me get a full refund in a timely manner.","6"

Haven't gotten it fixed yet. Other than that, it's ok. Games play great, Photoshop runs great, Unity 3d runs great.<br /><br />It's rather thick and heavy, but that's to be expected since it's got high-end hardware: it needs a built-in fan to compensate for the heat. As for said built-in fan, at least it's pretty good in cooling down the laptop. It's noisy, but gets the job done. You don't really need to get a laptop cooler/stand to cool it off.<br /><br />One annoying thing is the USB 2.0 port is on the right side, and it gets in the way if you're using a mouse and you're right-handed. I'd plug the mouse on one of the USB 3.0 ports (they're on the left side of the laptop) but all my external drives are plugged to those ports already.<br /><br />The battery life is also quite short (especially if you're going to play a game), but I use it as a workstation at the office anyway and it's plugged in the electrical outlet all the time, so I don't care about that.<br /><br />Computer Upgrade King partitions the hard drive for you. If you don't like that, you should reformat the hard drive (and reinstall Windows) before you start using it. They also put a rather large sticker on the left side of the trackpad, which is kind of annoying, but I think it acts as the warranty seal, so best not to remove it if you want that warranty service.","0"

Runs fast as I would have expected it to. A few things that kept this from being rated as 5.<br /><br />1. I tried to run Win 10 preview on it. Everything went smoothly until virtual box attempted to virtualize the network card so my VMs could have internet access. It crashed my system and it was never able to load again. This may not be an Asus problem because we are talking about WIndows 10 preview which isn't ready for the public yet, however, others with different machines have no problem doing this.<br /><br />2. The infamous mouse pad. I got this as a laptop so I could use it on the go where there is no surface to use a regular mouse. I'm just not impressed with it. when i move my finger on the mouse pad, the mouse does not move smoothly and it's hard to get the mouse on a button. It can be very frustrating, so then I just need to find a surface so I can plug in my regular mouse and that is sort of a inconvenience when I'm in a hurry.<br /><br />3. The power button as a key among the keyboard. This one I could have discovered from the picture, but there are just some things you don't think about when buying, so you could say it's my fault. What I've discovered is my toddler likes to touch the keyboard, and I just let him sometimes with supervision, but then he hit the power button so easy one day just by pressing all the keys without knowing what they are. On other laptops the power button usually is harder to press. You have to focus energy at the point of your finger to hit the power button. So that turned out to be an inconvenience to me because it was easier to press.<br /><br />Couple of Pros worth mentioning:<br />1. I immediately replaced the hard drive with an SSD and it came apart smoothly to do that unlike other laptops where you feel like your going to break the plastic because you are pulling so hard.<br /><br />2. It's fast :)","6"

Limited # of USB inputs.  Pros: superfast (have i7, 16gigs, hybrid drive) boots in less than 10 seconds.  3 seconds or less from &#34;sleep&#34;.  Has legitimate 4+ hour battery.  running FaryCry 4, Metro Last Light, L4D2 all at highest settings.

Having used both Asus desktops and laptops for many years now, I knew what I would get is quality. My expectations were very high, and yet it still managed to surprise me.  Build quality is top notch. Sleek and thin for a gaming laptop. Aside from the trackpad, nothing about the exterior feels cheap. The keyboard is great, keystrokes are buttery smooth. The speakers are surprisingly loud for and clear for stock laptop speakers. The display, oh my... the display. I've only ever used TN monitors so the leap to IPS was quite a big one. Factory color settings are abysmal out of the box so it will need calibrated. Once properly calibrated using the Windows Display Color Calibration tool, colors and images pop to life. Another aspect of the display i'm extremely happy with is the choice of matte over a glossy type. I can sit in front of a window, or a bright lamp can be just over my shoulder and there are almost no reflections. The glossy display types reflect surrounding light like a mirror and lead to quick eye tension headaches for me. So far, i've had not even the slightest bit of eye discomfort while viewing this display. Next we have the trackpad... the reviews weren't lying. It's bad. It feels unresponsive, laggy and cheap. Coming from an Asus G60JX which had a phenomenal trackpad, this was definitely a noticeable downgrade-- time to break out the mouse. The laptop uses the integrated graphics for a majority of activities and will only switch over to the GTX 960M for intense rendering. This means for basic use, the temps stay very cool. I own a heating pad from my last gaming laptop, but i've not had to use it so far with the GL551. While gaming, it did get warm but not HOT like my G60JX, which one could substitute as a fireplace while gaming. Cold boot time is 14.56 seconds from off to desktop. Photoshop opens in just 4 seconds which is really nice. The HDD is also split into 2 partitions, each 465 GB.  I bought this forastrophotography (planetary imaging) and some mild gaming; it's handled everything i've thrown at it so far. I really couldn't ask for anything more. The only thing I intend to change is the HDD which will be swapped out for either a 512 GB or 1 TB SSD. I plan to convert the 1 TB HDD to a storage drive and i'll be set. Now if it can just stand the test of time like my previous Asus laptop (6 years old), then I will be extremely pleased.  Update (6/22/15): Not even a month after writing this review and my screen is defective. Green/pink flashing colors, bleeding colors, extreme ghosting, strobing horizontal bars, etc. I disabled the graphics chip and ran GPU only, problem persisted. I disabled the GPU and ran chip only, problem persisted. Uninstalled drivers and installed the newest versions. It wasn't until I rebooted the laptop and saw the green/pink bars on the boot screen that I realized it was a screen issue and not software. It's boxed up and en route to Amazon for a refund. Really bummed, it was everything I wanted in a laptop. However, if I pay $1,200 then it needs to last longer than 3.5 weeks.  Update #2 (7/03/15): I liked this laptop so much, I decided to try one more time. Amazon was stellar about the refund process, which is why I continue to buy from them even in the event their prices are slightly higher. So, two things to note that I noticed right away: 1) The first laptop arrived with the manufacturers tape broken. Someone cut it, and placed packing tape over the Asus tape to reseal it. This should have been my first red flag, but I assumed it was an employee checking to make sure the correct machine was inside. Unlike the first laptop, my replacement arrived with never-opened, black Asus tape. 2) The first laptop had abysmal color settings out of the box. It took about an hour and multiple calibration attempts to get it where it needed to be. Unlike the first, the replacement has flawless color calibration and perfect gamma with no needed adjustment. At this point, i'm convinced the first laptop was an RMA'd/return that, for whatever reason, was put back on the shelf and sold as factory new. I have adjusted my rating, and will give a third update in one month.","2"

I didn't think it would bother me as much but after using top of the line laptops, it's very difficult to handle a cheap screen from the 90's where you have to angle it perfectly just to get a good picture.  What good is a gaming laptop with a crappy screen?  Even doing everyday things like watching Netflix makes it very annoying.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake I made after being so drawn to the hardware specs that I figure the complaints about the screen was just people being picky.  Turns out it's just not worth having all that power working on a very bad quality display.","1"

Some say this is the Power Membrane defect (whatever that vague prognosis means) but it seems to at least partially be an auto switch off when it gets too hot. After 5-10 minutes I can turn it back on. As it gets older it has been doing this more - I now put a desk fan facing it if it's a particularly hot day and it seems to help, but that's highly impractical year round.  1200 dollars and within 2 years I'm unable to play any video games for more than 10 minutes without this issue arising, not sure I'll buy any more Toshibas.  2) The wifi card seems to be affected by the heat and/or auto switch off. I've had to reset it after the above auto shut-down several times (just take the battery out, hold power button for 30 seconds, put battery back in and turn on). Now I'm getting regular wifi connection issues though, which can be a financial liability with my at home business!","0"

They have all the bells as whistles you want in a gaming laptop. The picture is amazing. The sound quality is ok but better with Bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />I can tell you that they &#34;take a licking and keep on ticking,&#34; to borrow a phrase. The one I'm currently using was accidentally kicked off its stand, into a metal cabinet, and onto the floor (it's a long story lol). I picked it up, put back everything that had been attached, and it worked fine after a few false starts.<br /><br />It did make me realize how lost I'd be without my laptop so I ordered the newer version one as it had even more bells and whistles. I don't ever expect to need them but it also cost less so why not buy it?<br /><br />I'm sad to report that I hadn't had it long before it also hit the floor but without enjoying a flight before the thud like this one which flew 4 feet before hitting the cabinet and sliding to the floor. So I haven't had an opportunity to see how well it flies but I can tell you it works just fine.<br /><br />I have no qualms recommending either the new or old versions of this computer. Just remember that video memory is piggy backed and you may have to reset it from some video-intense games. So far I've only found one game where it had to be reset so it doesn't seem to be a big problem, especially since that game isn't even on the market yet.","0"

However, I rated this one star because apparently I received a refurbished product. After a couple of days using my laptop I started hearing something moving around inside it. After much personal debate on whether I should send the laptop in for repair or not, I decided to open it and take a look. Before I could take any screw out I noticed that one of them had the head stripped/worn, as if it had been opened a few times and the screw had given out.. Apparently my \\""new\\"" laptop that I paid $1000 for was not as new as advertised. Amazon customer service is awesome, and I honestly have always felt protected with them, but since I doubt there is anything they can do for me, I just vented here. Apart from the worn screw, what was moving around inside was a loose screw that had come off the hard drive caddy.","2"

Just in time for the weekend - I had cleared my schedule and my girlfriend was busy with classes for work; ensuring I'd have a solid 48 hours of gaming bliss ahead of me.    I booted up and got to the point where I selected my house WiFi and... frozen screen. I waited a good ten minutes before performing a hard reset, said a quick prayer and... frozen. Again - Locked on a screen telling me it was trying to diagnose the problem. So I waited. I left it on for twenty minutes hoping against hope that it would say, \\""Just kidding there, old sport! What do you say we go climb into a space ship and fight some pirates!\\""    But that time never came. An hour of tech support with ASUS and XOTIC PC and I realized my gaming adventure would not be happening tonight and given the proximity of XoticPC to my house - not this weekend either.    To be fair - it looks like my experience is somewhat of an anomaly and that Xotic does a good job on the whole. That said, I will be returning and probably just buy from my local Microcenter so I can play this weekend as planned. While this wasn't the best first try, Xotic's customer service has been prompt, polite, and professional. Going forward I will give this company another chance when it's time to upgrade.

"B00K6ZIFFG","Lenovo Y50 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Gaming Laptop PC (Intel Core i7 2.4 GHz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 1TB Hard Drive, Windows 8.1) - 59426255","3","2015-07-07","A Laptop with Exceptional Specs but Disappointing and Worrying Build Quality.","Moving on from a Macbook White early 2008 model to this laptop, the Lenovo Y50-70 touch, is a significant update.  Not in terms of just specs but also in freedom functionalities and control with the hardware and Windows OS, programs and games.  However, there have been quite a few issues with this laptop, the Lenovo Y50-70, as well as the Windows platform, especially coming from Apple's OSX, where it &#34;just works&#34;.  There is no doubt that the Lenovo Y50-70 touch is a good laptop in terms of it's specs and price.  A a laptop with 15&#34; screen, an i7 and a GTX 860M compare price-wise to current Macbook of the same price and other Windows platform laptops in the same spec range, the Lenovo Y50-70 touch is your best bet... almost.  The most important part of this laptop is the graphics card, which I assume most, gamers on a budget and on the go, will be aiming to buy.  It's a well performing mobile discrete GPU.  Don't expect to run 4K at 60FPS or even for more modern games at 1080P at 60FPS but the GTX 860M can hold its own with relatively older games.  Expect to play at least medium to high mix settings at 1080p and achieve 60FPS.  Current games I've tried is Kerbal Space Program: No problems.  Counter Strike: Global Offensive: No problems, 60FPS achievable.  Fallout 3 GOTY: No problems (visually and performance but you will need to optimize it yourself though... many guides are available on Fallout 3's steam forums and on the fallout 3 subreddit).  Dragon Age: Origins: High settings 60FPS.  Batman Arkham City: Can run on med/high mix settings and achieve an average of 60FPS.  Many videos available to show the performance of the Lenovo Y50-70 on YouTube.  The battery is alright off power supply.  At low light settings and using energy manager I can use it for at least 1-3 hours, which is acceptable being that there will be very little situations where I will be without a plug nearby.  The problems with the Lenovo Y50-70 touch are stress-fully worrying.  The build quality and materials are cheap.  Most likely one of the compromises to get it to this price range (from launch of product).  The hinge cover can flex to the point of cracking, especially if you open and close the lid/monitor frequently.  As seen in my photo, a crack has formed near the screw.  This is the SECOND time this has happened.  The plastic is just too weak.  The replacement of this part is not under warranty and it has cost me a lot of time and money (4 weeks of waiting and almost USD130 replacement costs the FIRST time).  A solution which may delay this problem is to loosen the two screws on the hinge cover to prevent a tight flex when opening and closing the lid.  The Windows OS platform comes with it's own performance problems as well.  There was also the issue of the Superfish malware/spyware incident, as recommended, always do a fresh install of Windows for every new computer.  I've also had problems of &#34;automatic repair loops&#34;, where the laptop has turned off and on.  Just now, before writing this review, the Lenovo Y50-70 froze and when reset was stuck on the Lenovo splash screen.  Overall, the Lenovo Y50-70 touch is just alright but disappointing with my relatively short time (less than 5 months of usage) with it being that more than 30% of the time being at the service centre and &#34;babying&#34; the laptop ever since getting it back.  It is difficult to use the Lenovo Y50-70 touch when you're afraid of every use hoping not to damage the hinge buy opening and closing the monitor by flexing the hinge and afraid of losing all your work and files to OS and hardware issues.","3"

I went into the return section, selected from the drop down menu indicating that the product was faulty, they shipped a new one to me with one day shipping (even though it said it would match original shipping, i.e. two day shipping). I received the new computer very quickly. Amazon provides clear instructions on how to return the faulty one and also provides print out postage so the process was free.    Updated Review:  Great laptop for the price. Plain and simple. This isn't the kind of computer that will run every game at 60 fps on max settings, but that isn't what you should expect when paying only 1,200 dollars. For the price, this computer almost couldn't be better. I am extremely satisfied.     The Good:  -Plays games well. Examples: LoL at medium-high settings averages around 150 fps, RUST on highest settings is about 40-45 fps (RUST is pretty heavy on the GPU).  -The cooling system in this computer is GREAT. Does it get warm? Yes. Does it get hot? Nope!  -Comfy keyboard, although I mostly use my external.  -4 USB ports    The Bad  -Slow cold start time (because no SSD, duh)  -Touchpad feels weird? I dunno, maybe I need to break it in.  -Screen is good but not great. I'm not sure if this is just a personal thing since I'm used to 15\\"" laptops with full HD screens- so I'm used to a higher pixel density.  -Fingerprints. Everywhere. Yay for microfiber cleaning cloths!    The Ugly:  -Not this computer! Let's be honest, you're looking at this computer because it doesn't have that weird back end that the other ROG have. Right?    Original Review:  Looks like the NVidia GTX 860M is malfunctioning (screen randomly flashes black when in use).

The case while sturdy does show finger prints, but not a big deal given the performance. So far the one negative i have is heat.  The bottom left hand side of the case gets really hot and is uncomfortable if you rest your hand on that side of the key board. I use a fan and make sure the vents are well clear of the surface when i place it on the laptop fan, which helps keep it warm rather than hot.

With that said this is the worst business purchase I have ever made! Within the first three months the battery supply had stopped charging.. I tried to call customer service as this should of been repaired through the warranty.. It was near impossible to find a phone number to call in the USA.. After long hours of searching through forums I finally found a number that worked.. I called the ASUS company and explained the situation.. I was told that their systems were down and they could not help Me.. To try and call back in three days.. I asked if I could get a confirmation number to make sure the case was documented for the next time I called in.. Fifteen minutes of doing My best, to explain to them why it is important to have the confirmation number, they gave Me one.. Three days past and I called them back.. The confirmation number I had seemed to be invalid and this time I was pretty much hung up on.. I did some more web surfing and found that numerous customers have had this same issues.. Only a handful of them were able to have ASUS resolve the problem.. I will list several reasons why you should not shop ASUS..<br /><br />1) No customer service<br />2) Faulty product line<br />3) The keys easily pop off the keyboard<br />4) The touchpad is off and doesn't work proper<br />5) The battery won't hold a charge and will need to be replaced as soon as you buy the product..<br />That means plan on spending another 100.00 USD if you ever need to use it wirelessly..<br /> (Can Google this fact)<br /><br />Sorry ASUS you FAIL!","2"

It has 4 total USB ports which is awesome and a cd drive which is hard to find now in laptopts. I love this computer and I am thrilled I got it.","1"

It has amazing graphics, speed, sound and a back lit keyboard.  If you're buying it just for gaming and you'll always game from home with a power source it's great. However, if you're trying to also use it for work or school, know that it is huge and heavy and the battery only lasts 4 hrs max which makes it challenging for those purposes. We had to buy a new, special back pack for it so he could take it to school.  I wanted the larger screen since this was replacing a desktop and I didn't want him peering at a little screen for gaming or writing school papers but it's really so much bigger in person.  A word of caution when setting it up, give it the time to do all it's updates without interruption.  My teen son lacked the patience and crashed it on Xmas morning leaving us without tech support to fix it.  Finally did a system reset and then let the computer do it's setup & updates without interruption the second time and all works perfectly.  From all my research calls to different tech companies the consensus was that Gigabyte is the brand that truly produces the quality making the slightly higher price worth it. Appears to be true of this one so far!","0"

"B00IXQE81U","CUK MSI 17.3-inch Notebook i7-4710MQ 16GB 240GB SSD + 2TB HDD NVIDIA GTX 960M 2GB Full HD Windows 8.1 Gaming Laptop","5","2015-01-29","A Top Notch Laptop From A Top Notch Seller","My entire tech setup badly needed an update, so I decided to go all out and upgrade my laptop, peripherals and TV (which I use as a monitor).  the core of this upgrade however was this beast, the MSI Dominator.  I purchased the one with the 32GB RAM version.  I've had it a few days now, so I'm ready to write a review.    First, the Pros:    This machine is an absolute monster when it comes to power.  It comes with a i7-4810MQ processor, even though it's advertised as i7-4800MQ.  So, you actually get a more powerful processor than what you think you're paying for.  I took it through all of the paces, I threw everything I could at it, including running over 30 simultaneous high-definition videos over 500MB in size at the same time.  No lag at all.  My last laptop would show lag at around 6-8 videos.  This is truly powerful.  I don't think there is a game I could throw at this that it couldn't run at the highest settings.  In fact, I think I would've been fine with the 16GB RAM instead of the 32GB RAM.  I could never do anything that would get the RAM to clock over 23% usage.  The CPU would come close to maxing and it still never went over 23%    The build is incredibly sturdy and high caliber.  From the moment you whip it out of the box, you know you've gotten something far beyond some HP brand laptop.  It's beautiful and feel like you could kick it into a wall and it would still work.  (Don't kick it into a wall, though...)    The screen runs 1080p native.  The picture on the monitor is very sharp and crisp.  I immediately could see the difference between it and my 720p laptop.  I also love that it's non-glare on the screen.  I often work with my back to the window and I hate it when the Sun gets in the way.  This doesn't reflect any glare, so I love that.    The computer comes with very little bloatware.  I didn't have to spend a bunch of time deleting things off of it that I didn't want.  I noted that before I purchased this some people complained about the bloatware.  I don't know if Computer Upgrade King did something about it, but mine only had about 3 or 4 programs on there, and all of them are helpful for gaming.  Plus it had Norton, but most computers come with that now days.  I'm used to like 20 extra programs on there I would have to delete.  This was far less than what I've experienced in the past.    Typing on the laptop is more enjoyable than the usual laptop.  The laptop is very thick, so your hands rest easier on the laptop when you're typing because its higher.  Also, the backlit keyboard is really cool to look at.    One thing I love in particular is the ports.  5 USB ports for all of my devices, I don't have to keep switching out peripherals.  In addition, most of the wired connections you need like your power cord, HDMI connection, Internet cables, etc... is in the very back of the laptop.  I love this because I lay in the bed with my laptop alot and work, and it's irritating to have the cords pulling on the laptop, or dragging underneath it and pulling out.    The laptop has surprisingly good sound for a laptop.  You can actually hear the bass when you turn it up, as opposed that empty tinny sound you get from most laptops.  It doesn't matter much to me, however, because I tend to use headphones or the speakers on my TV, but it's something I thought I would point out.    Now for the Cons:    It doesn't run DVDs, apparently. It's a Blue-Ray player and so I couldn't get my DVDs to work on it.  That caused a headache for me, because I was using an old version of Word and ended up having to upgrade as it wouldn't play the disc.  I had the same problem with my workout DVDs.  I'll have to use my Xbox to play my older DVDs.  Everything else it played fine, but just not DVDs.    It's very heavy.  It's heavy because of the study build, thickness and all that they've packed into it.  This is a tank, so consider that if you're going to be mobile with it.  It's not a big deal for me as mine will be mostly sedentary.  But it's big and cumbersome.    That is literally the only two cons I can think of when it comes to this laptop.    Overall, I would give this laptop a 10 out of 10.  I would also give Computer Upgrade King a 10 out of 10 as a company.  I researched for a good month for the best deal and this laptop blew everything else out of the water.  You're not going to find a laptop with these specs that jump between 1200 and 1400 dollars like this does.  (I got mine at a 1300 dollar price point, but it went up.)  Plus CU King's service was top notch as well. Their representative took less than 12 hours to e-mail back when I had questions or requests.  The computer was very safely packaged within THREE boxes, with Styrofoam, and Bubble wrap between them.  Even if you got a bad delivery guy who flung the box like you see in the news, I doubt it would damage it the way they package this.  And most importantly, it came on time.  I couldn't be happier with the service or this product.    PS: On an aside, I have to mention that I also got a gaming mouse called the \\""Redragon Perdition\\"".  The two of these items combined have totally transformed the speed and efficiency in which I work, game and surf the web.  I highly recommend you check that out here on Amazon, too.  I'm not a shill for those guys, it's just that I got these two things in conjunction and both of them are absolutely incredible together.  I even got their lighting to match.  I love it!","4"

At first I was extremely satisfied but about 3 months in I started having issues with the power supply. In closely checking the computer I noticed one of the hinges was missing a screw and the other hinge was cracked. Then now I have to go through all the trouble of getting it repaired which is costly to me since I am a college student and I need a computer for college. I don't know if they will cover the cost of the hinges even though I have had the computer for a very short time. I am extremely dissatisfied with this computer and I recommend you stick with desktops since they last longer guaranteed.

Oh, HUGE point, ASUS is one of the only &#34;affordable&#34; desktop replacement makers who include a Thunderbolt (MiniDP) connection, this pairs well with a 144hz monitor... read below, I never knew that 144hz monitor (MiniDP to DP, NOT HDMI) would make such a difference both in gaming and my daily work use of the machine.<br /><br />Dislike - Not to detract from the pluses, I love this laptop...<br /><br />For the life of me I cant figure why they only have 3gbps support for the extra hard drive bay.  Since we are buying a $2300 laptop, they should expect us to modify the somewhat small 256 gb Bay 0 hard drive with an upgrade, thing is, it has M.2 SSD in Bay 0, which is smaller (and faster) than the 2.5&#34; drives.  Problem is, they don't include a bracket to support the 2.5&#34; hard drive in the M.2 bay (although you can connect with mounting bracket).  Really ASUS??  You built your reputation around performance and catering to gamers, this is a substantial oversight.  That being said, I used my 1TB SSD to replace the 7200 spin 2.5&#34; in Bay 1.  Would have been nice to have my 1GB SSD in bay 0 though.<br /><br />Next, the G750 it just replaced had the brushed aluminum for the top of the keypad area, this is plastic, very nice plastic but still plastic.  I guess it cut down on the weight a bit, but again for &#34;premium&#34; it was nice to have for the ounce or two of weight it adds.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is a laptop that scored in the 99.91 percentile on SiSandra (no modifications) and it plays demanding games (Crysis 3, BF4, etc...) on ultra high settings and still gets 60-80 OR MORE fps.  On slightly older games, it simply maxes the FPS beyond my monitor's 144hz refresh rate so I cap it at that.  COD :AW for example is capped at 90 FPS, with everything on highest there is (except pre-loading shaders), this machine EASILY maxes out the 90 FPS limit.<br /><br />Again, well worth the money despite the couple of nits...  if you are looking for a cutting edge (almost bleeding edge) laptop that will stay relevant for some time to come this is an excellent machine.  Side note, just sold my G750JX on the big auction site for $1150... for for the 15 months I owned it, it cost about $50 per month.  Excellent resale value when upgrading.<br /><br />Unless you can wait until fall when they come out with a slightly newer version (this already has the Haswell and 980m, not much better than that available), get this now and increase the time you have it while its cutting edge... Oh, and when they say that the nVidia 980m gets 75% to 80% of the performance of the desktop GPU, INCREDIBLY, it does.<br /><br />If you get this as a desktop replacement, make sure you get a 144hz display to go with it, don't waste this on a 60hz HDMI connection, use the Thunderbolt (Mini DisplayPort) and connect to a faster display.<br /><br />Yes Thunderbolt works as DisplayPort and will work with any monitor that supports DisplayPort, JUST BE SURE TO GET A MiniDP (Thunderbolt) to DisplayPort adapter... its a mechanical conversion (mini to standard) and you don't lose anything going from MiniDP to DP.  Unlike if you use an HDMI to DP where you sill still only get a 60hz refresh rate due to the limitations of HDMI.<br /><br />Happy gaming...","9"

Their are some things to beware of when you buy though.<br /><br />First thing: The SSD and the HDD come with a lot of partitions. You could use the disk manager in windows to change this if you don't like the way it is setup. Be warned, change this first if you don't like it. Any data added will be erased when you change it later!<br /><br />Second thing: They laptop comes with the sound coming out the left of the computer. There is a fix for this. Open the Asus sound manager and adjust the speaker balance to the far right. This will balance the sound to come from the center of the laptop.<br /><br />Third thing: This laptop is very big! It will not fit into many bags; including bags that say 17 inch laptops. The only bags i found the fit the laptop are the Everki bags like the Titan and of course the Asus Nomad backpack.<br /><br />Is it powerful enough? Yes, it can run Star Citizen fully maxed at 1080p. It can run Unreal 4 editor without slowdowns or problems; it only took me a minute thirty to build lighting in the &#34;Cartoon Castle&#34; demo. Unity runs fine, as always. Visual studio 2013 is great. Have yet to try 3DS Max 2015 yet, but Photoshop runs great.<br /><br />Advice: Keep SSD split into 2 partitions. Install all programs on non OS partition, along with ever games you wish to install. Change the default directories like Music, Videos, Downloads, etc to the HDD.<br /><br />Will edit this in a week with better updated info.","5"

It will max pretty much any game you throw at it with great frame rate with the Nvidia Geforce GTX 980M, which is probably its main selling point. This laptop has lots of other features that will make this attractive to potential buyers, such as a respectable Core i7 processor, a 128 GB SSD boot drive with an additional 1 TB hard drive for your other programs and games, and a Blu-Ray writer. The laptop also has an amazing cooling system built in as well, comparable with the cooling system of an ASUS ROG laptop. My GPU maxed at about 75 degrees Celsius after playing Far Cry 3 for a couple of hours on max settings. Great laptop, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking at getting a gaming laptop.","1"

The screen looks amazing and is very clear. The brushed aluminum look is kind of annoying only because the massive amounts of fingerprints but I can get passed that. Also, the trackpad isn't the greatest, you have to press pretty hard to click which can get annoying. The only other con I have is that the CD drive itself is very and I mean very flimsy. If you accidentally hit it on something when it's open you could break it easily. Besides that this is a great laptop for the price and I recommend it.","2"

"B00T7EXKLG","ASUS G751JL 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","4","2015-08-15","Great laptop for the price, no regrets.","Hi, I used my mom's account for Amazon Prime.  I don't regularly write reviews, and won't be going into the technical aspects of this laptop. Consider this a consumer's report, without comparing to other laptops.  This laptop runs anything I throw at it, sometimes I need to lower the graphics on newer games, but a change from ultra to high is still extremely good. As far as this laptops ability, I'm very impressed and glad I purchased this one. It never heats up or gets loud. I keep it on my lap most of the time, and in intensive gaming, it gets a little warm, but only a nice amount! It is a bit bulkier, I had a hard time getting a bag to fit it. I can't rest it on my knees when I'm sitting for too long, or it will start to hurt, so I usually have it rested on my thighs.  How easily greasy it gets is not an understatement... The material it is made out of really emphasizes any marks it has on it, but the screen has never had any problems. Audio wise, it works great for movies/tv. I wouldn't use it for gaming if you are an audio fanatic- you can notice sort of a metallic sound if it gets too loud.  The escape button isn't a problem as soon as you realize &#34;Oh stop doing this habit&#34;.  My biggest issue (which isn't really even an issue!) is that I ALWAYS seem to press the button for the CD Drive. Whenever I grab my laptop, I can be sure I'll probably accidentally open it.  It had a lot of bloatware, freeware, whatever you want to call it. I started uninstalling a bunch of things, but got lazy and gave up.  Overall, once I got used to this laptop, I loved it. This is coming from a pretty heavy gamer who moved from an older PC. I originally looked at a more expensive version of ASUS ROG, but am comfortable with the purchase I made. I feel like it can handle anything thrown at it, and one of the clear reasons to get a more expensive one would be for longevity, it would take much longer to become outdated than this laptop.  EDIT: Used it for a couple months now. Some updated input: It gets real greasy that is noticeable under light, like smudges everywhere. I don't really even notice it though so it's fine. The audio does have its problems, I like to play it loud and can it has a noticeable metallic sound if it gets too loud. The bass isn't that great- but I think it's better than having no bass at all. You only really notice it on your legs and if your hands are resting on your laptop.   Regardless, I love it, wouldn't have chosen another of the competitors around the same price. For you League of Legends players, uncapped this machine gives me around a constant 200 fps with Very High graphics. I don't use any streaming devices though. I play some graphic-intensive games like Kingdom Come: Deliverance on max settings, and it works just fine. I haven't played any extreme ones like Last Light, but I did play Bioshock Infinite and had to go to the second highest setting and it was perfect fps.   This is a laptop that is going to last in the gaming industry a good 4-5 years. For any regular users? This thing will be like a magic carpet ride. Games are already hitting 100gb file sizes, so I can see my storage getting full very quickly, having 1 TB storage.","1"

I found the laptop surprisingly light in my delight cause you don't want to be carrying a 10 lb laptop around on campus However, there are some factors in to the laptop which prevents me from giving it a 5/5.  The speaker quality isn't that great. I saw a review somewhere in here sounding like it was underwater, in which I have to agree. Another downside to this is that the fans gets LOUD when playing mid-high games (League of Legends runs pretty quiet, but games such as Total War or even rendering a video from After Effects or Premiere will get the fans pretty loud).Though both can be solved simply by just putting in a headphone Also, there's the infamous Machine_Check_Exception error that still occurs sadly (All over the forum) with certain programs.  Though overall, I personally enjoy the laptop as it's light and reliable for college. Personally, I would prefer longer battery life, but then again... It is a gaming laptop, and you can't really complain with about 2-3 hours of life. Overall, great laptop for the price, so if you're on a budget for a gaming laptop, I would recommend this. Hopefully my roommate doesn't get fussy when the fans get loud and he's studying. :)","0"

I have been looking around for THE gaming laptop for the past month, comparing acer, asus, alienware, and msi laptops as they're stats were the best. Asus had a high rate(like maybe 3% chance) of BSOD reviews; so they were out. Alienware costed a little bit too much for me to feel good, but they're product reviews are certainly the highest in the business. The reason I wouldn't have felt so good about alienware is because the price was 300 bucks more for a laptop like this one that CUK upgraded for me. Plus, even when you buy from the nicest shop in the business, things AREN'T meant to last forever. People need to accept that fact. I hope this laptop lasts me 5 years, but if I only get 3 from it, that is acceptable. However anything less than 3 is not, that goes for relatively cheaper laptops too. I was seriously considering the acer v15 aspire nitro for 1199. But then the sale ended on amazon... it's now 1800 for a new one...my bad. My second chance was this CUK computer. The only thing I can't believe is how they only had a single laptop in stock. Soon as I bought this one, amazon puts up the &#34;no longer available&#34; sign, so I hope this computer isn't a dud. I will edit this post once I receive the computer sometime next week.  EDIT 1:  So I received this computer exactly 3 days before the earliest time it was due, so amazing one day shipping even though I selected standard! I received it in awesome condition and am super excited to boot it up, can't wait till tomorrow! I received the main package this afternoon, which held the laptop inside. I plugged it in so I could charge it for 24 hours before booting it up, even though CUK probably already did that when they did the ssd upgrade, but just making sure. After all I keep telling myself its a 1500 dollar laptop....half of what my car is worth. I went to work 8 hours, and came home to my mom slightly freaking out about a 2nd package... So my heart is racing, maybe they wanted me to set my boot programs then send the laptop in with the new ssd drive to them to upgrade, then I would get it back? With thoughts like that running over and over in my mind, I shredded the box. Inside was a glowing dragon. A fluffy dragon... It was a Laptop backpack from msi!! Haha, silly texasjdj, thinking (well, not the worst, but) bad thoughts about what was in the box. It was a laptop backpack with a pet fluffy dragon, a gaming headset! a keyboard cover, a necklace, and a mouse pad. AMAZING! I love msi and cuk. Thanks a ton, still dreaming!  Edit 2:  So I hope this isn't heading the wrong way. All I've done so far is configure some settings on the computer, such as put in my microsoft account, change it to eco boost, etc. Nothing heavy at all yet. I started the process of making my backup disc recovery. I finished that, then put in the charger, charged it to 100%. I then turned off the computer and went to bed(unplugging it, as I wanted to see how my battery was doing so this was a test). I get up in the morning and the battery is completely dead...........So far still hopeful.  Edit 3:   Yeah I'm leaving edit 2 up there to my shame, but to my credit I still had it at 4 stars. So we fixed the problem. It was a tough problem, one that took hours and sleep to fix. They call it...human error. Yeah the battery is fine and we'll just leave it at that. My minimum cpu usage was 15%, so when I &#34;shut it down&#34;(it went to sleep instead because I closed it too soon I guess) it was still using tons of juice. minimum is 0% now, as it should be and the computer is amazing. Totally worth it. About to test out gaming capabilities tonight.","1"

It took about a week, and it came back intact and working superbly.  It works much better than it did when I got it.  It was the mainboard that was faulty.  The replaced it.  They sent (within the packing ) a sheet with the service information and what was done to the laptop.  As of today, I am glad I decided to keep it.  It is a very good machine.

"B00NJVRTHE","ASUS GL771JM 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014]","2","2015-02-22","Great MULTI-MEDIA laptop  NOT true ROG.  One heck of a machine either way.","The headline says it all.<br /><br />I purchased this laptop as a heavy video editing/photoshop computer for processing high resolution images on the go.  I needed something that could push 4k video to a larger monitor.  (the gl771 IPS screen is only native 1080p fyi).  After expanding my ram to 16 gb and adding an SSD in the expansion slot its turned out to be a smooth running beast.  For my purposes, this laptop is choice!<br /><br />As far as being an Republic of Gamer's series laptop,  it eeks by at gaming with a solid B+ (settings at high on 1080). However if you plan on getting into GPU intensive gameplay such as Crisis or Tomb Raider you will be sorely upset with its performance.  On \\""Ultra\\"" settings and even \\""high\\""  you will see the Nividia 860m throttle creating chop/screen tearing with FPS around 20 to 30.  Core Temps will often times hit between 83C to 90C decreasing the performance of the GPU considerably.  This is further compounded by the computers lack of intake ventilation grills on the case to feed the large exhaust grills on the side.  The only intake vent found is on the bottom of the case and sits below the mouse pad where the RAM slots are rendering most Cooling Pads useless to help force air in to cool cpu/gpu.  ASUS has also integrated a passive heat cooling system that will allow for the heat to release through the keyboard.  Under heavy load you will feel heat rising from the \\""Y\\"" key and just above the mouse<br />pad.  In my opinion its no supplement for good active intake vents for fans.<br /><br />If you are a serious gamer looking for a portable solution,  I would recommend looking at the GL771's big brother the G751 with 980m graphics card.  Its double the vent size for better breathing and the 980m GPU doubles the clock of the 860m.  Nothing will slow it down even set at maxed settings.<br /><br />After having this laptop in use for the last few weeks, I have a good feel out its pros and cons in my perspective.  Here they are:<br /><br />Pros:<br />860m maxwell with Geforce experience handles 90 percent of games at high settings and offers a gaming optimization feature<br />Sleek and stylish.  Nice brush finish.<br />Large backlit keyboard with number pad for easier data entry<br />Amazing IPS screen with increased viewing angle and vivid colors for image work<br />I7 cpu handles everything you throw at it.<br />custom ROG sound settings for gaming and video use.<br />Decent stock sound (no bass/mini subwoofer like other gaming laptops)<br />Super quick starts<br />ASUS has an incredible tech help line<br />Easy access PCI express port as well as hard drives/ram<br />Strong bluetooth connections<br />WIndows 8.1 is easily compatible with 360 controller drivers and works with all my old programs from windows 7<br />The amount of ports for connectivity is wonderful<br /><br />Cons:<br />Brushed metal top and mouse/arm guard leaves smudges on everything!!  nightmare to keep clean.  Easily scratched<br />lack of proper venting throttles the 860m GPU for heavy gaming<br />Games will sometimes crash when throttled on this laptop<br />Battery is very poor.  Gaming gave me tops 90 minutes of use.  Everyday tasks will give you about 3.5 hours.  Be prepared to be wired to wall<br />DC power supply has no light on it to confirm power is surging through it.<br />Cheap thermal pasted used on CPU and GPU.  Better thermal paste could lower temps by 5C easily.<br /><br />In conclusion, this laptop us a beefed up version of ASUS ultrabook N551 with a 17 inch screen instead of the 15.6.  Similar specs/similar design. However it suits all my needs and some for media work.  I would have only reconsidered this purchase if I was to planning to game much more than i do.<br /><br />*****************UPDATE*****************************<br />28 days later from this purchase and Im returning the laptop.

"B00ZUPO7A4","ASUS G751JT 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","4","2015-08-26","Great Laptop, Only Minor Issues","I just got my G751JT 2 days ago, and so far am satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />This is my first forray into the gaming PC scene, and actually my first laptop in general. I was hesitant at first, since there are so many other options out there for consumers. I've heard good things about Asus though, so I decided to jump right in and splurge on a powerful laptop from them.<br /><br />I knew what I was getting into regarding the size and bulk of this hefty machine, so that wasn't an issue for me.<br />So far, the speed and power of this shrunken down desktop seems nice. I haven't played any games on this yet, besides running some things I've made in UE4 and other programs. It handles multitasking well, with no slowdown while I ran UE4's high quality textures on ultra settings and had multiple instances of YouTube and various webpages in the background.<br /><br />I only have two issues with this computer so far:<br /><br />1.) Battery life.<br />Now again, I knew what I was getting into with this laptop, but it still came as a surprise to me to see that spending 15 minutes on battery mode simply browsing the web (low screen light, low keyboard light) dropped the battery from 100% to 89%. It certainly is meant to be plugged into a wall outlet at all times via the huge brick-sized charger. Thankfully, this isn't much of an issue as I normally have an outlet available to me at almost all times.<br /><br />2.) Internal temperatures.<br />I've read how this thing stays &#34;extremely cool and quiet even in poorly ventilated areas&#34;, most reviews have stressed this fact over and over again. So naturally I assumed this would be the case. However, this hasn't been my experience. While the laptop does indeed stay quiet, (haven't heard it make one noise yet, even while running CPU/GPU intensive applications) it does not stay cool for long. I could use the rear vents as a radiator during the winter! Although, to be completely fair, I don't allow much air to get throughto the underside (I've mostly used it flat on my bed, not much room for air intake I'm sure.) Yet I have also tried giving it plenty of space underneath, with comparable results (still hot, even while browsing the web.)<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with my purchase. Hopefully this will last me a few years so I'll have my money's worth. From my experience so far, I'd recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a fast laptop.","2"

"B00X5X2MW8","HP OMEN 15.6 Inch Touchscreen Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7, 8 GB, 256 GB SSD, Black) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M","5","2015-08-28","colored to look like delicately seasoned exhaust venting heat efficiently and evenly","It's been a while since I've been awed, however briefly, by a new piece of consumer technology -- but the new HP Omen did it a few times. I am a developer and travel a lot to work in live broadcast. I use this as my primary computer at home and when traveling. It's incredibly thin and powerful. The furnished chrome, colored to look like delicately seasoned exhaust venting heat efficiently and evenly, is beautiful. The speed at which the OS was waiting for me on first boot, and the five seconds it takes to go from the powered-off state to the login-screen on successive boots is incredible.<br /><br />Overall thoughts<br /> - The power supply was surprisingly smaller than my other gaming laptop power supplies<br /> - The screen, while beautiful, is way too glossy. This is my first non-Matt screen in a while, and it feels like I am looking in a mirror sometimes<br /> - Yes, it's a &#34;gaming&#34; computer (ie, it has awesome graphics performance and a great cpu), but I'm not a gamer; I got this for maximum productivity & portability… HP did a GREAT job not being overbearing with bloatware (yes, such a good job that it deserved all caps), but I don't think  shortcuts to the few games that are preinstalled should be on the desktop.. Keep it clean like the rest of the product<br /> - The first time I rebooted the computer, after uninstalling the THREE &#34;bloatware&#34; programs and disabling UAC,  it took less than 10 seconds. FANTASTIC.<br /> - The USB 3.0 ports are fast.. I got 99+ MB/s with a 5400rpm external hd. I ended up buying a 7-port external usb 3.0 hub for my home desk which has an external keyboard and mouse, card readers, cd-drive and usb--&#62;ethernet adapter plugged in so when I get home all I have to do it plug in 1 usb.<br /> - Windows [search] \ Folder Options --&#62; View \ &#34;Use check boxes to select items&#34; needs to be disabled by default. Seriously.<br /> - The sexy edge at the forefront of the computer, which I often find my fingers pleasantly resting on, may be a little sharp for those who let the computer rest against them.<br /> - The bottom of the computer is mesh for ventilation… this can get pretty hot if sitting on your lap. I bought a computer fan table that cools the computer while resting on my desk…. CPU temps usually around 40-55C with this.<br /> - The screen does a very good job at staying where I put it.<br /> - The LEDs, which unexpectedly/pleasantly greeted me upon power-up, are not individually addressable, so they should not pretend to represent an equalizer when music plays. There is still a Windows 10 bug that ignores the &#34;animation&#34; status of the OMEN keyboard lighting control option, so each time I reboot the computer, the LEDs animate with sound. Not cool in the professional environment I use this in.<br /> - I love the connections being in the back, however, one or two side USB connections would be nice. Also, I'm not sure if having a rear-connecting headphone jack would be good for gamers?  I had to buy another headset if I want to use a mic, because it's a headphone/mic-in-one jack<br /> - No ethernet port. This is a killer…. Almost good enough to lose a star (but not). Not sure if the provided USB--&#62;ethernet is 100Mb or 1Gb?<br /> - The horizontal size and sensitivity of the touchpad is good.<br /> - Keyboard layout… the first time I typed I pressed the caps lock instead of 'a' because the keyboard is shifted oddly. It took me a while to get use to this but now it's fine. If HP chooses to stick with this layout, the overall size of spacebar should be reduced on the right side, so that the edge is felt and the alt key is easier to press… This would orientate a first-time user better, and match more closely a standard full-size keyboard. It would also be helpful to have a distinct physical bar separating the 'a' key from the caps lock, reminding the user of unique key locations<br /><br />Nitpicking thoughts:<br /> - Both the i7 and GTX stickers wereunevenly placed (mismatched angles compared to the keyboard)<br /> - Ships with near 15GB on a recovery partition. That's kind of a lot, especially considering I will never use that because I make a HD image with CloneZilla often and would never use the patriction for recover. Thankfully that space is recoverable with Windows these days.<br /> - Blurry text by default: to fix…<br />  Right click on the Desktop, Select Screen Resolution, Select Make text and other items larger or smaller<br />  Check the box which says Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays, Set to Small -- 100%unevenly placed (mismatched angles compared to the keyboard)<br /> - Ships with near 15GB on a recovery partition.

"B00NJVRTHE","ASUS GL771JM 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014]","5","2015-03-17","Loving it so far","As someone who jumped ship from having a macbook pro since mid 2010, you can imagine I did a lot of research before investing in a PC.  As someone who needs a laptop for work and for gaming I was tired of a mac so when I read up and looked into the ASUS rog series I was immediately hooked.  The graphics are awesome when I play games like Star Wars: the old republic and world of warcraft (granted you can run mmo's on potatoes and they look good but coming from a 5 year old macbook pro with a gtx 330m being able to run these games on ultra made my face tingle).  I know a lot of people have complained about getting faulty units of this model and saying how the screen flickers black when they play games and that it must be a faulty graphics card and I will say that I did get one with this issue however instead of just returning it to Amazon I researched the issue and called ASUS customer support (who were extremely helpful) and they processed an RMA for me right away.  No questions, no skepticism or &#34;turn it off or on again&#34; non sense or &#34;oh must be nividia's chip or you must have a virus or the game is not supported&#34; they were quick about the process.  TURNS OUT for all of you who might have this problem that it is NOT the graphics card being faulty but actually a loose connection with one of the LCD cables between the screen and the video card (or motherboard or something) and they literally opened it up, fixed it, and shipped it back out to me the SAME DAY they got it at their service center (just as an FYI, this cable issue and a dead graphics card have similar symptoms but a faulty graphics card will get more severe than the LCD cable issue I just described).  I tested the issue last night and the black flicker was gone.  I understand people getting frustrated with a faulty model on delivery after spending all that money but life isn't always perfect and you don't send your car back if a tire blows out...you get it fixed!<br /><br />All in all I'm more than happy with the service and treatment I got from Asus' customer support and from what I've heard it is a LOT better than customer support from other laptop manufacturers so I'm fortunate for that. I plan to get more graphics intensive games in the near future so if I don't forget to do it, I'll update this review after I see their performance.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend Asus to anyone looking for a new computer.  Even my computer savy friend (moreso than me) said how beautiful this laptop and it's specs are even after I told him about the small issue so if you get a similar issue be patient and don't freak out at Asus.<br /><br />Awesome for what it is.  A great gaming laptop at a good value.","7"

It is a fingerprint magnet, but I used a microfiber cloth once and it cleaned everything right off.

Originally I was going to buy a Cyber power fang book, but they refused to ship to my address because I have a PO box for regular mail. Even though they were going to use UPS to my physical address, they refused to ship because credit card &#34;billing&#34; address was a POBOX. This was very frustrating. I live in the Tonto National Forest in AZ, so mail here is a bit goofy. They wanted me to drive to the bank and send them a money order....I told them forget it. If it was this hard to buy a a laptop from them, I would hate to see what would happen in the case of a warranty claim.<br /><br />Basically, the cyber power is just a re-badged MSI computer. Would I didnt realize was that the MSI was all plastic and not as solidly built as this ASUS.<br /><br />after my deal fell through, I started researching heavily. I ended up going this route. The hardware in this machine is prety impressive for the price. Every game from BF4, War thunder, to Arma III runs great. I bench marked war thunder on maxed out settings and averaged 80 FPS.<br /><br />BF4 will average about 50 FPS with high settings. Some complain about the screen, however its not that bad.<br />Also, I really like the aluminum body, and was a major factor in my reason for choosing this machine<br />It helps keep it cooler and the overall feel of the machine seems nicer then your typical plastic laptop.<br /><br />I have gamed, edited video using sony vegas, which requires rendering, as well as digital art. This machine handles it all very well without breaking the bank.<br />The speakers could be louder but are not terrible, I have heard much worse.<br />The nvidia 860 gtxgraphics card and and intel processor are a great match and do well to run current games with respectable settings.<br /><br />The machine only has one major vent on the left side however, so when running games and pushing the GPU, it can get hot! make sure to keep no obstructions in its way and using a cooling pad with it is not a bad idea. I use a slim pal master cooler pad.<br /><br />The Wifi seems strong and has no problem picking up and connecting quickly. The only con for me concerning this laptop is that is has only one HD bay. I got the SSD model with a 256 GB SSD installed. I wanted more space, but only having one HD bay really put me on the fence. I ended up settling by removing the optical dvd drive and installing a second SSD HD by using a caddy.<br /><br />I rarly use the DVD drive these days and in fact, many laptops including macs dont even come with dvd drives anymore. If you really need a dvd drive, just get a USB drive and utilize that space for more memory!<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this computer and feel I made a good purchase. I was also suprised to learn that the ASUS's warranty for a year includes accidental damage such as spills and drops. Having a 7 yearold in the house, this was a nice added piece of mind.ions in its way and using a cooling pad with it is not a bad idea.

First, the basics: it's super fast, the screen is big, bright and crisp, there's lots of memory, etc... But these are things you'd expect of a laptop at this price point.  The two features that really sell this machine are its GPU and its cooling system.  The GeForce GTX 980M is awesome.  It easily runs games in 1080p at 60fps.  My last laptop GPU couldn't even come close to this, so bravo nvidia.  Gaming laptops tend to run loud and hot, but not this one.  I've run games on it well over an hour at a time and it stays cool to the touch and the fans stay whisper quiet.  Plus, the intake vents are at the back of the computer, not on the bottom, so you can actually use this laptop on your lap without blocking the vents or your lap getting too hot.  So, bravo Asus for the cleverly designed cooling system.<br /><br />The only issues I have with this machine are very minor.  The battery life is very short.  I consider it to be more of a UPS than a battery.  But if you're in the market for this kind of laptop then, like me, that probably isn't a major concern for you.  There is some bloatware, but it is easy to delete.  My only other complaint is with the optical drive.  Its location on the left side of the case is such that it's easy to accidentally press the button to open it when picking up the computer from the sides.  This wouldn't bother me except for the fact that I will never use the optical drive, so every time the tray accidentally pops open it's a reminder that I paid for something I won't use.  Like I said, a very minor issue, but I'd rather Asus offer a model of this machine without an optical drive for a few bucks less.<br /><br />Minor quibbles aside, this is a fantastic machine that I expect I will enjoy for several years.","3"

The chassis also says a lot about the performance that is packed inside. The model I chose came with the GTX 980M and the 4710HQ. This PC will handle practically anything you throw at it. It can almost be used as a desktop replacement but I wouldn't dare give up my GTX 780 SLI build. This is probably one of the fastest if not the fastest gaming laptop on the market right now. SSD's make for some quick loading into games, I was always the first guy into a CS:GO comp match waiting for everyone else to connect. Though with a massive 1TB HDD you don't have to sacrifice space either. The 1920x1080 IPS panel is vibrant and also 75Hz which is a nice boost over 60Hz. Even shines brightly though a matte finish. The keyboard is one to love and it feels like your fingers are floating on air. The touch-pad is responsive but see cons below.<br /><br />I bought this model - http://amzn.to/1E9lbDD<br /><br />Battlefield 4 on Ultra... that's about all the info you need there.<br /><br />Cons: Though it is not without its little quirks...<br /><br />1. Blu-Ray eject button is weirdly placed, can't tell you how many time I accidentally ejected it.<br />2. The keyboard is great but there's no distinction between keys so it is easy to mistype.<br />3. The touch-pad is great once you remove the gestures, with gestures on you do a whole bunch of random things like zoom in and out.<br />4. The IPS panel did have a bit of light-bleed which is to be expected.<br />5. &#34;SSD's in RAID0&#34; a bit misleading.<br />6. They keyboard keys are hard to see without the back-light.<br />7. Makes random mechanical noises, kinda sounds like the first tone on a dial-up internet connection.<br />8. Ginormous and heavy!<br />9. Short battery life with no Nvidia Optimus. 4 hours if you are lucky in normal use, 2 with gaming.<br />10. Sound feels &#34;hollow&#34; and does not give it a good feel of presence, sub-woofer just makes it sound one sided.<br />11. Doesn't make pancakes.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: I actually got this model for review on my YouTube channel(FatedCb) and I was pretty happy with it. I think it is a great PC and well worth the money. You definitely get a quality product that you can rely on but do keep in mind the little quirks it has. I think there are other models that would better suit most people though, this is a bit on the pricey side.

I bought a MSI GS60 Ghost 003 laptop before purchasing this one. My thoughts at the time was light and powerful, but as time went on, I just felt like the laptop was not worth the money I paid. I returned it and when I saw this bad boy I pulled the trigger. After a month of using the laptop, I am very impressed with the build quality and performance of this laptop.<br />My MSI GS60 boasted a steel series mechanical keyboard and multicolored backlit keyboard which was sweet. This ASUS doesn't have a multicolored backlit keyboard (just red) but the keyboard feels better than the GS60 when typing. The trackpad is actually very good and usable.<br /><br />I have since installed a Samsung 840 EVO ssd in the laptop and so far everything is great. I love the design and the laptop stays cool through hours of gaming. This laptop is HUGE and heavy which is the opposite of what I wanted initially, but with performance like this, I could not complain too much. If you are thinking about performance, this laptop will deliver and then some.","2"

Been using it for a couple weeks mostly for heavy photo/video editing. And I love it! I've read some negative reviews regarding bad QC, but mine worked fine. It does come with some bloatware, but those can be easily removed. Love the 17'' pristine screen, and it processes programs so much faster. So far I have had no issues. The cooling system is amazing on this laptop. The temperature near the Keyboard and palm area is always cool, unlike my old laptop; it would start getting warm as soon as I started running games/programs. As for speakers, I've no complaints. It's much much louder and more clear than the Dell laptops I've owned. You can adjust the quality of sound through the audio wiz program that comes pre installed. Don't expect a Bose sound quality with laptop speakers.<br />There are some set backs, which I don't necessarily consider as cons. Asus has added its own &#34;record function key&#34; right above the esc button on the keyboard. It took some time getting used to as I used to accidentally hit this key all the time, though now not as big of a problem.<br />Also the CD/DVD ROM button is positioned poorly, as I've been hitting it accidentally and the CD drives keeps popping out.<br />It is some what a finger print magnet, but I always clean my hands before I touch my precious electronics, so it has not been much of an issue for me.<br />In short, I think this laptop is a great buy! It's been running smooth for almost 3 weeks now! I've no regrets!","3"

I played games that did not require high graphics, but it ran Sony Vegas pretty smooth. Video processing in HD was much faster than my old notebooks. A 10min Full HD video was rendered under 30 minutes, which is quite good.<br />- It’s very light compared to others gaming notebooks, which makes it quite portable. Plus the power supply is also pretty slim, which is also a great portability factor.<br />- Loved the keyboard feeling. Keys are “soft” to press which is good for any typing activity.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The fan was sometimes a bit loud and the notebook did get hot sometimes.<br />- It has only 3 USB ports and one of mine worked for only a couple of months. I had to buy a USB hub to replace it.<br />- For some reason, whenever I was using a double screen with a Monitor or TV, I had to adjust the scale of my secondary screen (usually a monitor) plugged through HDMI. And also the sound sometimes were awkward when using a LED TV as my secondary monitor and I had to unplug and plug the HDMI cable again to fix. Maybe that’s a Windows issue, but it only happened with this notebook (got two other notebooks).<br />- I had an accident with my microphone stand and it damaged the notebook screen. Since I’m from Brazil I sent an e-mail to Razer Support. They told me that they could fix everything but they would charge me around 600 dollars for new components and labor hours. Plus I had to send it to U.S. and pay all shipping fees, even though my notebook had less than a year (still on warranty). That’s when they told me that ANY WARRANTY IS CANCELLED if you take your notebook outside the U.S. That’s very disappointing since I would have to pay a total of a thousand dollars including international shipping fees and taxes. Just as a comparison stand point: I used Logitech support and they’ve sent me a new mouse for free even though I was in Brazil.","0"

I didn't notice a huge difference between mine and my friends new G751 with the IPS display and 970m.<br /><br />Pros:  Speakers are amazing, keyboard is quiet and customizable, tons of USB, quiet for most games, upgradable internals/graphics, 2 year mfgr warranty (vice 1 for ASUS), can hold up to 4 m.2 SATA3 drives in raid should you decide to upgrade later.  With the existing hardware, windows boots in about 4-5 seconds.<br /><br />Cons:  Price, m.2 SATA3 drives are relatively expensive for HDD, You WILL need a bigger backpack.  Here's the backpack I ended up getting.  The laptop is thick so its a rather snug/tight fit (in the dedicated laptop compartment) but the bag holds everything comfortably...and laptop fits easily in the main compartment if you want to put it there or carry a second computer.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007R6JPC4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13<br /><br />Other info:  SATA 2 connection on main drive SATA 3 for the M.2s<br /><br />Usage:  Gaming and watching videos.  The bluray player works great and I haven't found a game that this machine cannot max out.  The fans definitely ramp up to a noticeable level on Battlefield 4 but the laptop stays nice and cool (I can't hear the fans with the sound up or earbuds in).<br /><br />***One side note is that Nvidia offers a free game with the 980/970m card.  My seller wasn't a part of the promotion and therefore, I didn't get a game so make sure you check with the seller if the free game is a deciding factor.<br /><br />http://www.geforce.com/pick-your-path-game-bundle","1"

I would advise you to be careful whilst considering this product.Here is why: First off, I will talk about the awful delivery and packaging. The delivery guy didn't even knock or ring the doorbell. The box was huge, and I mean gigantic. It was many times larger than the laptop's box and there was no form of protection in it other than the foam included within the box of the product. There was enough room for the laptop to fly around in the enormous package. I also don't live in a nice or safe neighborhood, so I was lucky to even look outside and still see the package there. All this aside I was happy to finally receive a laptop with good specs for some decent gaming power on the go. But then.....<br /><br />I started playing with my new Laptop:<br /> Build Quality and looks are fine, however it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. The sound was pretty good too, and the fan wasn't too loud. However the track pad, although it works fine, does feel very tacked on and flimsy. I can see how it can be annoying for a lot of people. Keyboard worked fine as well. The screen however was quite washed out and colors and lettering was blurry. There was an insane amount of bloatware, much of which can ruin your experience. For example, there is a program by lenovo that indicates whether CAPS or NUM Lock is activated, on your screen. Whatever you do, do not activate this once it asks you! I did so unknowingly as I thought it may help me when I'm not paying attention. Once I started playing games on steam, every time I accidentally hit CAPS lock it turned the screen off, and after a few seconds on again. I then had to find a solution online for several minutes before I found the associated program. Anyway, it actually runs games very well and quickly, loading and even boot times are very fast; I was quite pleased with this.<br /><br />FAN OF DOOM<br />Eventually I started realizing a noise....a noise so brutal, even the devil would stir in his sleep. It was a clicking noise that I at first mistook for the HDD spinning, as this is common for any computer. But this sound was incessant and much louder than any HDD. It turned out to be the fan on the bottom of the device. When under normal or idle stress. the fan spins, and then for a split second stops, only to repeat this process over and over. It is so annoying that I could not possibly bear using this laptop. Any time I am surfing, deleting or installing programs, it is there to haunt me. And performance takes a significant dip while not plugged in by the way==&#62; only able to play games on low or medium (Warframe).<br /><br />They could've had a killer product with this. Instead I'm looking at Acer Aspire V15 Nitro Black Edition over at eBay via newegg. It's selling for $800 bucks right now. It seems to have a better screen, fan, cooling, and design. Track Pad is supposedly awful, but I use a mouse most of the time anyway and I'm sure it can't be as bad as they say. I'm not picky with track pad or keyboards. Hope I could help","2"

Cons:  - After owning the laptop for a month the battery was not charging fully.  Had to send it to Razer for repairs which took 3 weeks.  - About half the time at boot-up the mouse pad would not work and require another reboot to work.  - The wifi card is horrible, compared to other laptops.  - Also runs hot when playing games.  - The display resolution is subpar compared to other laptops on the market.  - Cannot upgrade components.  RAM is soldered on and there is no option to upgrade.    Pros:  - Good performance speed.  With SSD boots up quickly and apps run fast.  - Good battery life, 6+ hours.  - Aluminum chasis is slim, feels solid and lightweight.

That being said, the specifications will price out quite higher if you custome built one to match this one.  It is very fast and is great with even the most demanding games.  The Monitor doesn't match its specifications.  While I'm sure it's 1080 as listed, is just isn't as sharp as you might expect.  Not a big issue when playing games, but is a little bit of an issue if streaming video.  The sound is the best I've heard from a laptop but the DVD/CD drive is way too sensitive.  If you close it too hard, it will malfunction and you have to shut it down and restart just to get your DVD out.  It is not Blue Ray as you might expect from a higher end Laptop, but that's not an issue for me.  The Solid State Drive is amazing...super fast and totally quiet (no moving parts).  I've had it on my lap for hours and it just doesn't get hot like other Laptops.  For a Gamer, that's more important than you might think.  My wife likes it because she shops online for hours and it doesn't get very hot.  Creating the backup DVDs was a HUGE pain as it takes 4 DVDs and I had to restart the process after each DVD because it wouldn't accept the next DVD.  This could also be an issue with the DVD drive, I just haven't had it long enough to tell.  I can tell you when I installed my printer drivers and then went on to install my Word software, the drive failed.....it was the second CD in a row so I restarted it and tried it again and it was fine.   This is the reason I gave it only four stars.    It seems to be built well and is lighter than my other Laptops.  When on charge or plugged in, make sure it is totally plugged in.  It tends to wiggle out as you move it around.  My other HPs had a larger jack on the end and stayed in the Laptop better than these tiny ones.....not a big issue, just something to watch out for.    I know I've identified a few issues that might throw up some red flags, but I'm trying to be open about my issues.  Howeve, this is still an awsome Laptop for under 1K.  I'm on the fence as to whether I'm keeping it or not....leaning towards keeping it.  I'm retiring my Desktop permanently and will use this one for Gaming and Work, so it has to be reliable.  A few more days of putting it through its paces and then I'll decide.","2"

As simple as that!! - ASUS G751JT review","I never gave a review on any electronic devices, so this is my first time. I am so excited to own this laptop. I was always impressed by ASUS Republic of gamers line of laptops for complete use of office, entertainment, and gaming (what not?). Especially with all the reviews online, I knew this was the right one to get.<br />I'm just going to dive in to the main features, feel free to comment, like, suggest or ask me anything about it or related to it. will be glad. :)<br /><br />Starting with its design and exterior looks, this laptop is just beautiful with its keyboard lighting, that helps you find your keys, esp. ASDW which is very important to a gamer. The typing is smooth, I already played some hardcore games (which is listed in the end), almost thinking I destroyed the keys, but it is so perfectly designed and spaced, for you fingers to move around, for both gaming and typing fast.<br />Similarly, the touchpad is just smooth, with so much surface area, to move across the screen/click on anything. Love it.<br /><br />Speed: With 16GB of DDR3 RAM, it boots in less than 15 seconds to the desktop already (imagine how fast with an SSD, then?) with a startup of at least 10 applications. Never have I seen something that fast. Even while browsing, running multiple tabs, playing many youtube videos in 1440p HD videos so smoothly. While browsing, through both chrome and explorer, it has been super fast, with its wireless type - 802.11 A/C, I am getting around 60 Mbps as download speed when my wifi server provides only 50.<br /><br />The Screen: Just amazing, with the IPS panel, no glare, full HD clarity, amazing viewing angles, with 17.3 inches and 1920X1080 resolution, it couldn't get any better!! No joke, watching all  tv shows, and movies on this laptop, and suddenly switching to my old lenovo or anything lower than this clarity, it just hurts your eyes, lol. NOTE: The screen quality is so good, that the last time I saw something this good is with the latest MAcbook pro which has the retina display, so yea, it is as equivalent to that.<br /><br />It comes with 4 USB ports 3.0, 1 VGA port, 1 HDMI, 1 Thunderbolt, 1 microphone, 1 headphone Jack, 1 DVD multi recorder.<br /><br />The camera has got around 1.2 MP with HD feature( which is absolutely enough and more I believe for skyping)<br /><br />The Vents right at the back, for both the GPU and CPU respectively, is perfectly placed, which is very important for gaming and heat issues. I always had issue with my previous laptop, with the chipset graphic card, and trying out load of games, always heated and crashed games and aps And so far, it has been running this one on top load, it just stays super cool, and so quiet, without making lot of noise compared to the desktop, which I should say is one the main features in this laptop. Perfect.<br /><br />Now coming to the main pros: The Graphics: with Nvidia's latest GeForce 970M (October 2014 released) with 3 GB graphics and a processor of i7 4710 HQ (2.5 GHz) quad core processor with 5% overclock, this is just what I wanted.<br /><br />To test it out, I played so far Titanfall, Fifa 14, Tomb Raider, NFS RIvals, CS:GO. Remember all these games are 2012/13 and above, so as to test out the latest next generation games and all of them in maxed out settings, (ultra) anti-aliasing at 4x, with every detail to be displayed. and result: I have never experienced something as good as this even with my friend's xbox one. No joke. I will be soon posting some gameplay videos through shadowplay to show how it actually is. I also used Unigine Valley 1.0 to benchmark my results (Do check the screenshot for it here) For now the game results are:<br /><br />Titanfall: 40-50 FPS, so smooth, I played like 2 hours continuously, with the temperatures still remaining at around 45 deg celsius, (which is not bad, I believe, anything less that 65 deg celcius, your gig is then running fine!) Oh and about the game, I am no expert, but it just blew me, with the advancement of technology used in the game, there is no way you can stop playing this online game, absolutely fun with the titans and insane graphics, especially on a dream machine like this. :)<br />FIFA 14: Just so realistic and beautiful playing this game. (can't imagine how it would be playing FIFA 15 then.) I got it for a higher range: 70-75 FPS range (since its not as demanding as titanfall, I believe), sometimes it dropped to 60-65 FPS when I played seasons with online friends (due to different internet speed are ports when playing online, I believe), but still not lagging at all even when it drops, which is just amazing.<br />NFS RIvals: Trust me, not a racing fan, but this is one of the best NFS released in the recent years, and it is plainly just amazing, you wont stop driving and racing around in so good clarity and background. Again, not even a glitch or lag, I got continuous 30-40 FPS on this too, playing it with my wireless 360 controller. I believe the game can go higher with the FPS, but its a game I got from torrents, and from reading the reviews since the update and patch wasn't the latest, there were chance of locking it to 30FPS.<br />CS:GO: Counter strike, well, might be wondering what's the deal in graphics here, but trust me, this is one of those CS gamess, where you get everything from 1.3,1.5 and 1.6 all in advanced and remastered edition that should just blow all CS fans and without a doubt the best CS game right now. It did give me a lot of memories playing good old maps such as assault, nuke,and de_dust2. :) It does have a lot of graphic options, in which I got around 250 FPS while playing it on complete high, which I have no clue how that happened, maybe a glitch. I turned it all down from high to ultra settings, and the FPS came back to 65-70, which was still smooth and really hard to tell the difference.<br />Tomb Raider: Like Titanfall, this game did make me nervous too, with the amount of texture, and details option, I still turned everything ultra and maxed out settings, and to my surprise I was still playing it smoothly, although the temperatures were a little bit higher than the other games. I must say this game does demand a lot of load and graphics. and I am glad that this machine plays it so well. and the game is just brilliant. A must play for any action-adventure fan. I got around 40-50 FPS on ultra settings( I use this setting only in case I need to connect it to a projector or a big tv screen), and 70-75 FPS when I lowered it to high settings, which I normally play with. Just simply smooth. :)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not a lot, but definitely the weight of the laptop, weighing 8.4 lbs (almost 4kg), it might be a little burden to carry around, but can get used to it.<br />The speaker sounds are not all that great, but decent enough for songs and videos. From what I read in the ASUS forums, it is a common driver issue that is causing it to sometimes give an unbalanced sound via speakers for everyone with the latest update on it. Probably rolling back the driver to the previous update or waiting for a fix by Asus is the solution. (If someone knows the fix, please do let me know) But not an issue, since I use my headphones most of my time. :)<br />The battery is built in, and I have tested around 2 hours and 30 minutes roughly to use it continuously for watching videos, using MS office, and other applications, all unplugged. If playing games, it might stretch around max to an hour before dying out, which again, battery life should not be a problem, cuz everywhere I go or use it, I plug in and no one wants to game without plugging in your laptop to get maximum performance. :) Other than that, its Windows 8.1, so far, not a lot of problems, except for the updates and here and there bugs that are common, that come and go, but a techy guy like me shouldn't even complain about it, but to work around and solve it. :P :) !!<br /><br />So far, three days, I was only able to try these many games(wanted to do more). Will be doing more games in the future with hopefully videos in you tube. Especially ones releasing later this year (Arkham Knight, GTA V, Mortal Kombat X, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and many more.) I hope I covered most of the important tech specs of it. I must say for the price, it is worth every penny (do check the link to see the cost and more specs and features), I was nervous at start, but couldn't be happier now. It is absolutely true, like they said in the amazon and newegg reviews, that it is truly a desktop replacement, if you're looking for something that can be portable, yet powerful, with stylish look and finish, and above all giving a performance of 110 percent. Welfl done ASUS. I look forward in the years, to upgrade the RAM (only if needed 16GB is way fast and sufficient) and maybe an SSD storage, and other accessories.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for delivering this on time and in perfect condition, since I did read a few reviews who had dead pixel screen, or windows not starting up, and some other issues. Thank god. :)<br /><br />Do check out the photos.

I look forward in the years, to upgrade the RAM (only if needed 16GB is way fast and sufficient) and maybe an SSD storage, and other accessories.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for delivering this on time and in perfect condition, since I did read a few reviews who had dead pixel screen, or windows not starting up, and some other issues. Thank god. :)<br /><br />Do check out the photos. Thanks for reading. :) :)","122"

It feels just a hair, not much really, tight to zip in the corners around the Lenovo Yoga 2, 2 in 1...  I expect/hope it will stretch a smidge in time.  Also, I had expected something of a smoother appearance, but the case bulges a tad awkwardly with the computer in it, especially with the cord in the front pocket (but the cord does fit, which is why I wanted a front pocket).  While I do believe that the case does function somewhat as protective, I was expecting something with a bit more structure.  Otherwise, the zippers, padding, and construction/sewing are well-made.<br /><br />Personally, I would not advise a larger case cover (i.e. a 13 inch) because the Yoga 2 would just swim in it.<br />I wouldn't want to accidentally drop my computer while in this case, otherwise padding seems ok for bumps during transport.<br />Horizontal zipper, as this case has, helps to protect the keyboard while in stand mode... just slide it in the case.<br />Case is reasonably priced, lightweight, and slim... fits easily in many of my moderately-sized handbags.","0"

I had seen some that marketed as such in the past that rarely, if ever, lived up to the term.  This laptop, however, left me in awe.  Normally, I run a rather hefty desktop with an FX-8350 processor and a GeForce GTX 770, and for travel and such, I decided to get my hands on one of these laptops.  I ran a few minor programs, watched some youtube videos, general stuff. Then came the big moment, I decided to install some games.  Watching some of my games, even the more demanding ones, run at 1080p with a smooth 60 frames per second made my jaw have a rapid meeting with the ground.  The screen on it could be a little better in the color department, unless you mess with some settings everything looks washed out, I don't mind the lack of touch and I think it could be a tad bigger, but overall, it's good.  The keyboard is nice and responsive, plenty of feedback and the backlighting does wonders, only gripe is that it can't be changed from the stock red, not a huge deal, but just something to note.  It also doesn't get too hot when running games.  I ran Payday 2, Watchdogs, and Metro: Last Light for several hours on end without a USB keyboard, the top of the computer gets a bit warm, but it's nothing uncomfortable.  The speakers, however, leave alot to be desired.  They're alright for general stuff like youtube videos or the like, but they don't go very loud.  For the average gamer, this isn't a problem with the wide market of headphones available, but even so, it could be just that little bit louder.  The battery life is also rather good, I left Dragon Age Inquisition running on mid-high settings, playing it off battery, the system hard-locks games to 30 frames per second when on battery in an attempt to conserve power and extend battery life, but it wasn't unplayable. This is also very easy to circumvent, but runs down the battery like mad. I went for a good threehours before needing to plug it in again.  The touch pad is just basic, no frills, nothing amazing, it does what it's supposed to.  I see alot of people talk about the power button placement, and while I can see how it would be a problem, it's really not that much, it's at the very top right of the keyboard, typically out of the way unless you use the number pad, even then, it's hard to hit.<br /><br />To sum this laptop up, it's pretty good if you're looking for a good gaming laptop, I've had it for about a month now and run my entire library of games on it with little to no issue, a few key games being a bit much for it to handle on higher settings..  It's a bit pricey for a laptop, but not as much as others on the market.","0"

It boots pretty fast, 7-10secs. And it runs every single app or game you throw at it. BTW Amazon service is amazing. They sent it a week before the promised delivered date. So I can't be any happier with my purchase and with them.

I checked, and the SSD is not in an area where it can be easily accessed, and the Q&A seems to suggest that replacing it would void a warranty.

I have purchased 5 of these for my business and developers I work with.  I wish I could say the same ASUS customer service  !!! One of my ASUS laptops has a bad power adapter and charger -- obviously for a $1500 computer that use everyday that is a problem.  I spent 4 hours on the phone and in live chat with ASUS -- it seems that they need to put the same effort with their customer support systems they do in designing their computers -- there is absolutely no excuse for me to have to fill out the exact same information 3 times when they already have it already when I sent in my warranty information and they even display it when I go to customer support. -- shame on you ASUS I have spent over $10,000 on your computers and you cost me a day of filling out forms and trying to get permission to return a faulty power adapter .. I ended up just buying one .. maybe that is why they do that ,. to make more money.  Seriously connect your systems together and you can easily auto fill a PDF form -- don't send me a blank one and ask me to print it out and hand fill it out.. with a fancy name like Customer Care who is actually measuring and looking at the customer experience.  I know some people try and cheat the system but not typically someone that has purchased 5 computers from you in a year.  I also spent an hour submitting my recommendations to ASUS -- I would expect at least a thank you if not a here is what we are doing to correct the issue we have with our customer service.  For a company that has motherboard in 20% of the worlds computers I think they need to recognize they are now selling to the public and businesses that depend on their products.  I hope maybe this finally gets some attention and you address your customer service. great companies listen and grow not just look at the bottom line.  Best Bob","1"

She is a gamer and is very pleased with the speed of this computer. She plays games like Minecraft, Starcraft two, Sims 3, Wow, and a lot of others, and the computer runs so fast like there is nothing on it. And the memory is perfect, out of all the games she has on the computer (which is like 50 games) there is still about 600 GB left. She is so glad about getting this computer, she can use it for school and fun time. It can handle so much at once, like a big game, facebook, pandora/youtube, netflix and whatever else she is doing. It is quite heavy for a laptop, but that is just nit picking.","0"

Runs all of my favorite games like a boss!  War Thunder, ARMA III, ARMA II run on highest settings.<br /><br />This is only my second gaming computer and it replaces another ASUS which I passed to my child so that we can play together.  Because I've never been able to legitimize purchasing a 2k+ computer, I have to go with mid level ones.  With that, it feels really good to see the Nividia app bump my setting up to improve gameplay.<br /><br />Besides the trackpad, it is good quality.

"B00FYNP9AY","Laptop Sleeve Bag, Evecase Ultra-Slim Neoprene Padded Sleeve Case Bag w/ Accessory Pocket for Laptop / Gaming Laptop / Notebook / Ultrabook / Chromebook","5","2015-05-01","Best Sleeve for Toshiba 13.3"" Chromebook 2","If you're like me you probably bought one or two sleeves for your device and never quite got a perfect fit. Most cases were too big. The whole point of buying a Chromebook/netbook/MB Air is to have something as small and light as possible. What's the point if your case is 2 inches to long and an inch too tall.<br /><br />Based on the listed external dimensions of this sleeve it looked like it would work for my Toshiba Chromebook 2 13.3&#34; HD - and it did, perfectly. I'd totally recommend measuring your device yourself and looking at the dimensions of this sleeve rather than the screen size ratings. There are so many aspect ratios and bevel sizes nowadays that's you can easily have a 2&#34; width variance on devices with the same diagonal screen size.<br /><br />If you have a Toshiba 13.3&#34; Chromebook 2 this is probably the best fitting sleeve you can get for it.<br /><br />Away from the device specific fit, the case is very well made. The padding is great. Zippers are beefy and the looks aren't bad (I would have preferred black on black, but whatever, orange is cool). The front pocket is probably a little small for a charger (although you could do it on some models with smaller power bricks), but it's perfect for smaller items like a notebook/pen, SD cards, USB drives, USB cables, dongles, adapters, etc.<br /><br />All in all this is a great buy. Don't be afraid to try it for a slightly larger device as long as you check the measurements yourself.","2"
"B00MMMMMX2","ASUS ROG 15.6"" Gaming Laptop w/ GeForce GTX860M 2GB GDDR5 and Optimus Technology","3","2015-05-01","Decent laptop for the price.","I had to return the first one I bought because I'm assuming it had a hard drive that was in the process of failing. Unfortunately, I'm not completely loving this laptop. It's fast, and yes it runs games very well that's for sure, but I didn't buy it just for gaming. The touchpad is just a nightmare. It's too large and extends too close to the keyboard, so that when you type, sometimes your palm will touch it and randomly place your cursor in the middle of text you've written. I find myself using an external mouse quite a bit.<br /><br />It's heavy, but I didn't buy it based on weight. I just needed something that would perform well.<br /><br />All of the laptops I've had in the past had charging ports on the right side instead of the left like this one has which has taken some getting used to for me.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Webcam is good quality.<br />Keyboard is very nice. Clean crisp keypresses. Backlight is useful at night.<br />Screen has no glare.<br />Battery life is decent on lower settings.<br />Screen size (15.6) is plenty large for every day tasks.<br />It's not too big to fit in most book bags.<br />Fan seems to be well designed for resting on lap (IE, intake and output is not blocked by legs)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Startup is slow with HDD option (I had to choose this due to my situation)<br />*Confusing graphics settings (One card, nVidia, processes the graphics, and the other: intel HD, displays them)*<br />Horribly designed touchpad. The whole touchpad is one big mouse button. It also extends too closely to the keyboard so that your palm will cause it to click while typing.<br />The finish collects grease too easily. Think your hands are clean? Nope, the finish on the back of this case will prove you wrong.<br /><br />*On the graphics: a lot of people seem confused about which card does what, and upset that they can't make the dedicated nVidia graphics card be the default. You don't want the nVidia card to be default for everything. It uses more power,more processing power, and more ram. For simple tasks, just let the integrated card do the work. When you're gaming, your computer should tell the nVidia card to process the graphics and the intel HD to display the graphics. You can make sure this is the case within the nVidia control panel.","0"

(fine. not the best start. but fine.)<br />As of Friday, 5 months down the line the machine didn't come out of sleep.<br />Got home from work, opened it up to use and kept returning to the BIOS prompt.<br />Contact Asus support and they opened a case given that it's within warranty.<br />Now it's being sent back to Asus's Repair Center in CA to be fixed.<br />-- They don't have any on the east coast, so now i have to wait for Fedex ground to reach CA from NY, wait for 5-7 days standard for them to fix it, and wait another 5-7 for it to get back to me)<br /><br />Disappointing that only 5 months down the road, with usage limited to a few games and multimedia it ends up dying with issues that look like a failure of either the SDD flash drive or CMOS/BIOS - either case pointing to sub-par manufacturing.<br /><br />Bought it as a sleeker and to an extent cheaper alternative to Alienware 17. And for the few months hat it did run, the performance was certainly to expectations.<br />However, this kind of hardware failure makes me feel I would have been better off with another manufacturer.<br /><br />Im currently on a Gateway as I type this - my old laptop. Had it since 2008, and other than its having grown slow with age, not one hardware issue ever.<br />If brand new, the Asus can crap out like this in just 5 months, even if the 'fixed' one does last a bit longer when i get it back, I doubt it could ever be as reliable and durable as my Gateway has been.

"B00SIJG2UW","Alienware 13 ANW13-2273SLV 13-Inch Gaming Laptop [Discontinued By Manufacturer]","4","2015-05-07","AW 13 review @ 2 weeks","DISCLAIMER: this review is based on the Intel i5-5200U 2.2ghz CPU, which is what stated in the specifications on Amazon, however in the title of this unit stated i5-4210u 1.7hgz unit.  I hope we all get the i5-5200u CPU since there's has been some complaints of the less powerful CPU being a limiting factor for gaming, but for $999 on a budget it was a deal for me either way.  I also replaced a SSD on my own.<br /><br />Pros: BATTERY LIFE, portable, relatively thin, screen resolution, powerful, runs fairly cool, as always cool FX effects with AW, decent speakers with AudioBlaster<br /><br />Cons: driver issues with trackpad (fix for this with link below), trackpad use overall not impressive, lack of a SD card port, not SSD<br /><br />Detailed review:<br /><br />First impression: AW overall is gamer's blood in design, IMO it makes people's common laptops looks dull, out of box the unit feels SOLID enough I can use it as a brick to hurt someone, so not light for a 13 inch, but it will not break your back, soft mat finish of interior feels soft/warm and welcoming but not for the faint hearted with feels of control/power for tasks, overall cool looking rig-on-the-go.  FX effects with AW sign lighted on outside lid and two lit trim lines in ~60deg angle going down while widening is just cool.<br /><br />Screen: this unit on Amazon came with HD 1920x1080 like stated, and I would not recommend anything lower since the screen is 13.3&#34;, my previous 14 inch with 1366x768 was tolerable but by no means great.  Viewing angle is good, color accuracy is also good but cannot beat by Razor Blade, but that cost $2000, at least I cannot tell the difference; but side-by-side by my Toshiba it's night and day.<br /><br />Keyboard: very soft and good key travel distance, I feel I have to press harder than my Toshiba but I am used to flimsy keyboards, a major upgrade nonetheless, chiclet type keyboard with center indentation on keys so your finger does not slip off while typing, which is a major issue on my Toshiba, lastly it's solid keyboard that have minimal flex when pressed, you have to press pretty hard to make it bend, so tap away.<br /><br />Trackpad: like I mentioned, a major weakness, Dell is known to produce great trackpads and I believe leader in trending gestures even in the 1990's, but AW despite apart of Dell now has its own ideas of optical input, obvious gaming mouse is the focus not trackpads, driver was a pain to get it installed BECAUSE it requires Intel IO I2C driver as a pre-requisite, should have been included in the Dell chipset driver, see my reply to thread of &#34;AW 13 touchpad driver not working&#34; on notebookreview for the fix, took me 2 hours to figure out, I hope it helps EVERYONE since no one else I can tell figured it out.  So if you ignored my review I hope at least you clicked on the link below, because one day when you DO have to reinstall you may get upset.<br /><br />http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/alienware-13-touchpad-driver.767297/page-2<br /><br />Performance: I am not going to cite specific 3DMark or whatever results, you can find those online, but overall it's a multitasker beast, I can listen to music, web browse, have a game open in background, word processing, running video program; with all this no lag despite not the i7 CPU, exactly what I need since I intended to use for &#62;gaming.<br /><br />Battery life: A major concern for most portable gaming rigs unless you wan to lug your LanBoy around and can find a socket anywhere; AW 13 at 38% brightness, listening to music, browsing web, typing, lasts 6 hours for me, but I also customize the power plan of balanced profile very specifically, such as sleep is not an option but hibernation is preferred, also I turn off adaptive brightness.  You can use AW Fusion in command center to achieve this also.  During gaming I would still recommend plugged-in, otherwise dependent on brightness/gameplay/game you may be able to squeeze out 3 hrs.  But you have  a powerful rig on the go with 6hr+ battery life with balanced profile, and release the beast when plugged in.<br /><br />Gaming: I play older games, have not tried newer releases yet on AW13, but Wolfenstein ET online with native resolution looks crisp, FPS of 71 not less than my beast-of-a-desktop, install ePSX playstation emulator for older titles you will be reliving all your favorite RPG without hiccups, and DOTA online is also easily playable, youtube vids of people playing BF4 also shows smooth play.<br /><br />Cooling: The unit is very quite during normal operation, I can barely hear it unless I put my ear next to the vents in rear, during gaming it does ramp up but not deafening, I would say 45-55db, otherwise with CPUID showing temps of 29-33degF idling and 65-70degF full load, GPU temp can get up to 80's degF, so I would prefer a cooling pad to maximize lifespan of AW13.<br /><br />Sound: the speakers are decent for a laptop, bass can be achieved with loss of crisp sound but improved with AudioBlaster program, I would turn on &#34;Dialog plus&#34; to crispen voices and &#34;EQ&#34; with &#34;Stone Hall effects@ 50%&#34; to get best sound effects you can out of AW13 without annoying echoing.<br /><br />Camera:  I am sure it's HD quality with minimal motion blurr unlike the subpar laptops, considering discrete GPU onboard, but I have not yet tested it yet.<br /><br />Overall impression: AW(13)some powerful rig on-the-go with decent gaming capabilities, if you want strictly gaming rig get the 15/17 inch or at least the i7 CPU.<br /><br />Of course I forgot about the HDD, there is no surprise here, SSD will dramatically improve your performance bcecause regardless of your CPU being &#62;1gigahz, no spinning drives (Raptor 10k rpm maybe?) can match the speed of CPU nowadays (if there is your laptop may catch on fire;), so your limiting factor will be your spinning drive.  My bootup time &#60;10 sec with Samsung Evo 250gig SSD, the Toshiba HDD 1 terabyte included is junk at best.<br /><br />Alpha","14"

I started with the base model, just 8GB and 1TB HDD and then maxed the RAM to 16GB and added an SSD. This thing does everything I want it to do and more. I am not much of a gamer, I mostly play MMORPGs in my spare time, so I can not attest to how this computer runs for the more demanding games.<br /><br />Pro: Love the keyboard! It is responsive, solid with no flex, and the custom lighting is pretty cool. This thing is light for a gaming laptop. It is not as thick as the pictures lead me to believe. It is decently thin and much lighter than comparable computers without feeling cheaply made. The screen has vivid color and great viewing angles. Upgrades were easy and the access panel came off without any issues, just use caution with the clips and you will be fine.<br /><br />Con: I wish it had two SSD slots. The 867 only has one mSATA slot. It is no big deal for me, but for some that may be a deal buster. The Opti boost sometimes gets a little confused. It will try to run using the Intel Grafix instead of the Nvidia card. I just disable it when I play games and have no issues after that.<br /><br />Overall, for the money, this is a very nice laptop and one that so far after a week is performing very well. I will post back if there are any issues, but now that I have the computer dialed in, I do not expect there to be any problems. Xotic PC is a great company, and one that I trust. They stand behind their products and are always available to help you with any issues you may have. That is why I went with them. A friend of mine bought a PC from them last year and had some issues. Xotic provided him with good customer service and got his issue fixed quickly. So I am hoping that if I ever have an issue with this PC that I can not fix, that they will be there to help.","8"
"B00TB8X8GA","Razer Blade RZ09-01301E22-R3U1 14-Inch Gaming Laptop","4","2015-05-14","Overall this looks like a very good alternative to a Macbook Pro 15” ...","My background: I wanted this machine primarily as a working machine and not a gaming laptop since it is incredible powerful and the 14” display make it big enough to work on it (programming) and small enough for travel (I wish there were more 14” laptops!). Overall this looks like a very good alternative to a Macbook Pro 15” or a Dell Precision 3800 (both with dedicated GPU) or a Dell XPS 15. Before buying I read a bunch of reviews and many people were complaining about stuff like the battery life, the trackpad keys or the glossy display (touchscreen version). Anyway, I wanted to paint my own picture since my use case may be different than the ones of many reviewers. My current machine is a 5 year old Toshiba Satelite R630 which is about to breath it’s last breath very soon. So an update came very handy and I did not mind a high price tag if quality and all my requirements are fulfilled. Review of: New Razer Blade 14&#34; QHD+ Touchscreen 256GB SSD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M graphics Price: 2399$  Pro: + Build quality: is outstanding, it feels like a raw piece of metal (heavy but also like it would never, ever break) + Display: Gorgeous, everything looks super sharp on the QHD+ display, adjusting the display with one finger is super easy and it stays exactly where you put it! I noticed reflections on the screen but not more than on any other glossy display. I did not work with it outside in the sun though. + Keyboard: I have never had a better typing experience. It feels better than the Macbook Air my wife is using (and 1000x better the one on my current machine :)) + Trackpad: I really, really enjoyed the trackpad! It is very smooth and you don’t feel any friction. The buttons below the trackpad make a very pleasant noise (many people complained about it, but I liked it!). I compared it to the Macbook Pro 13” trackpad (the one with force click) and Apple is still ahead of their competition (although I also enjoyed the trackpad of the XPS 15). But if you don’t compare it, then you’ll be very happy with this trackpad. It is very good! + Gaming: as I sad above, I did not buy this for gaming but I you have a machine that powerful standing on your desk…I just could not resist. So I installed Hitman Absolution and played a little bit on the highest setting. Everything looks wonderful and amazing and the Blade did not choke even a little bit! + (Shipment/Return: I received the machine after 2 days and was able to return it without any issues. I got my money back 7 days.)  Neutral: +- Noise: the machine is quiet in normal use. The fans will kick off when playing games, but hey, that’s what they are supposed to do and usually you’ll wear headphones anyway. And even with fans kicked on, the fans sound good (high quality) and were not really bothering me +- Heat: I did not experience any issues with heat. The part above the keyboard got warm while playing Hitman, but that wasn’t really bad.  Con: - Wide bezel: Although the display is super nice, on thing that caught my attention right after booting the machine was the thick, wide bezel around the display. I told myself that I will forget about that soon, but every time I looked at my old machine (which has a fairly thin bezel) the thought came back. Also, when looking at other machine (e.g. Dell XPS 13 2015), the future seems to be no bezel and I find that much more pretty. - Touchscreen: I bought the touchscreen version because of the higher resolution (and also because I was a little tricked by all the ads that tell us “touchscreens are necessary in Windows laptops nowadays”). The truth is, I played with it for 5 minutes and used it never again. It seems complete useless to me and I would rather buy the version with a lower resolution without touch (that should also boost the battery life a little bit). - Performance: To be honest, I did not run an actual benchmark or stress test but these are my observations: -- When switching between windows/app using the touchscreen I noticed a short glitch every time (maybe an OS issue?). -- I used chrome to browse on Facebook and when typing a message the message would appear 3-4 seconds after I typed it. I tried Internet Explorer and IE Metro and both showed the same issue although not as bad (maybe 0.5 second delay). I don’t know why that happened considering the stats of this beast it seems impossible. My internet connection should not have been a problem because I was able to browse Facebook on my old machine without any issues and no download was active in the network. - Battery life: I unplugged the machine, set the brightness to the lowest setting and disabled sleep mode etc. Occasionally I would look some stuff up on the internet but 80% of the time it would just sit on the table with some programs and apps open (Internet Explorer, Chrome, bing news, ...). Result: 5:30 hours of battery life. Not really good. And it did not meet my expectations at all. - (Ubuntu compatibility: When my old Laptop (Toshiba Satellite R630 – 5 years old) starting lagging, I put Ubuntu on it (for the first time in my life and I was a pretty hard windows advocate). I really fell in love with that OS and do not want to miss it anymore! So my plan was to use Razers powerful hardware and incredible build quality to get an ultra-portable Ubuntu workstation. I did not too much research for that so when I got it I discovered that many people experienced many issues and the battery life drops to 1.5 hours (https://insider.razerzone.com/index.php?threads/linux-on-a-new-blade.4115/). Really disappointing for me, but actually not Razers fault because they never advertised the Blade to work with Linux. For me it was a bummer nevertheless but it does not affect my final score since I could have known about these issues and the machine is not made for Ubuntu!)  General experience: Overall I had a nice experience with this laptop. Although I have to admit that I did not feel a big difference when I was onlyworking on stuff. Browsing, writing documents and so on is something I can still do on my old machine and the nice keyboard and track is only nice if you have in mind where you come from and what ‘bad’ feels like. But overall I did not have the ‘Wow’ effect while using the Razer Blade. Everything felt very, very nice, but it did not feel like it is worth the 2400$. This is only my perspective and people who use this machine mostly plugged in AND they like Windows 8 AND they actually use the touchscreen AND they do not mind a shorter battery life AND they actually use it for gaming will probably have a way better experience than me. I will give this machine 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4) since it does a very good job at everything it advertised. My use case is different and I had just hoped I could have used it for that. Unfortunately not so I sent it back.","40"

"B00SIJGRJ8","Alienware 17 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop","5","2015-06-05","Absolutely Phenomenal.","I've had my share of experiences with various &#34;gaming&#34; laptop and desktops and this has to be one of the best ones out there. The biggest draw in was the price. Alienware? for the PRICE? Ironically, the once outrageously expensive gaming laptop computer company is now one of the best price per performance contender. i7 4710hq gtx 980m 1080p 17&#34; ips display rgb keyboard 1th 5400hdd + 128gb mssd all for $1850. The closest thing is a clevo branded laptop. Every other brand is at the very minimum $2000. So, how is it? Does it feel cheap? or Premium? As you can see by the 5 stars, it's obviously the latter.<br /><br />The build is VERY solid. Excluding the touch pad and the Keyboard, the inside is mostly a rubber coating material. The drawback is that it's pretty easy to stain and noticeable in bright light. The benefit is that it's super comfy. I much prefer it to the metal hardness found in my previous macbooks. The keyboard is also another huge plus. Great tactical  feedback and a perfect normal layout with absolutely no bending. I hate it when companies try to change the keyboard into a &#34;gaming&#34; layout. It looks ridiculous and sometimes they bring in weird, useless programs. (Looking at the g751 and the big steam picture button). Upgrading from a thinkpad x1 (arguably one of the best laptop keyboard) was no sweat. I found my wpm VERY close to when I type with my fully mechanical keyboard. Huge plus for the keyboard. In fact, I switched over from my razer blackwidow mx blue to this keyboard.<br /><br />The display is full ips panel that works very well. I haven't experienced the notorious back glow yet and the viewing angle is pretty much near 180 degrees. I heard that the max brightness wasn't bright, but I beg to differ. Using the display to halfway was more than satisfactory for my liking. Colors were sharp and accurate.<br /><br />The lights are another thing I can't stop obsessing over. I thought it was a pointless expense until I actually started playing around with it. It's really fun to change the color to your liking and it also looks cool. The software to set up the lights is extremely easy. basically, there are different zones and you change the color of the zones. (Ex. the numpad is a zone and the power button is another zone.)<br /><br />The touchpad is a little iffy. For mine, the buttons actually don't work and many of the gestures are very buggy. I will reinstall the drivers and update this review. Luckily, I have a wireless (g602) mouse I carry everywhere.<br /><br />Speakers are very mediocre. As I carry my iems everywhere with me, I am not really bothred with this. However, if you expect &#34;killer&#34; audio, errr don't.<br /><br />Now for the internals.<br />Cooling: This was something I was very worried about. There isn't much room for the air to get in underneath the picture. If you look at the picture, all thats holding up the laptop is 4 small rubber stands. After playing around with several programs aka games, I've observed several key points. No matter the usage, the cpu temperature never went up 80 Celsius. 2nd, getting it above 70 Celsius is rare. In idle, it simply won't happen. When gaming a high cpu usage game, it tends to average around the 76s. Keep in mind, I'm using the A01 bios, I heard different Bios versions affect the fan speed and settings. I wish we had manual control over the fans as I've noticed the fans don't really kick in until somewhere around the 70 range. These temperatures are completely fine with intel cpus. If you're worried about it dying, the laptop will probably be very old and in need of a replacement before the cpu dies.<br />The GPU temperature is just absolutely splendid. Never, Not once did it go anywhere past 70 and this was a gpu stress test.<br />What surprised me in addition to the temperature was the sound. I don't hear the fans, like at all, unless at very high cpu and gpu utilization. Very solid cooling.<br /><br />(edit 7/13/2015)<br />I'venoticed something particularly interesting about this alienware. Specifically, the BIOS. I strongly suggest users of this laptop to use the A01 or A00 version of the update. While they may be the oldest versions, they cool MUCH better than the new ones. I've experimented and noticed the A00 version cools consistently more than the newer ones. (im talking about 10 degree centigrade difference)<br /><br />For the performance, it's what you expect with an i7 4710hq and a 980m. There are thousands of benchmarks. In gta5, with mostly very high maxed settings averaged 50-60 fps depending on the action. Killing floor 2 max was pretty much 60 fps all round. Dota2 smooth and no lag.<br /><br />I also like to comment on the software. NO BLOATWARE. When I received this laptop, I immediately noticed how clean the metro page looked. I only uninstalled 1 program that many might still find useful.<br /><br />However, one major con is the 180 watt charging pack. I heard numerous negative comments about it so I decided to change it immediately. After contacting Dell through email and then the phone, I received the new charging pack ONE DAY with free shipping. This blew me away. They delivered it in less than 24 hours after I finished the phone call. Absolutely phenomenal.<br /><br />This laptop is already great without the optional amplifier, which is another huge plus in the laptop's longevity. 5/5. Exceeded expectations.<br />Will keep this updated as my experiences go by.<br /><br />6/16 2015 edit:<br />Touchpad is working fine after some tweaks. I reinstalled drivers and the buttons work fine. Gestures are still glitchy. When doing two finger scrolls, it'll change directions depending on the program. For example, for chrome it might be scroll up to go up, but for a different program, it might be the opposite. I disabled the gestures completely. But other than the gestures, touchpad is quite good. Smooth, nonspazz-like. Shame gestures don't work well.<br /><br />Another point I forgot to mention is the battery. Its real tiring carrying a 240 watt charger wherever you go, especially when you're not going to play games. With this, I actually don't have to carry it everywhere. With the power-saving option and 50% brightness, I'm able to get 5 hours of WORKING life. No airplane mode, idle tests (who uses those?). I'm talking 5 hours of multiple chrome tabs, couple word documents, and itunes playing music, aka real world scenario usage. Possibly one of the biggest battery life in a modern high-end gaming laptop.<br /><br />Now, going back to the cooling point. While the cpu and gpu temperature is quite good, I've noticed that the keyboard does tend to get hot. While not unbearable, it might be quite uncomfortable for other users out there. I tend to just man through it.<br />Keep in mind this was after like 6 straight hours of &#34;working&#34; (gaming).I strongly suggest users of this laptop to use the A01 or A00 version of the update.

"B00T7EXKLG","ASUS G751JL 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","5","2015-06-16","Superb upgrade to the ASUS ROG line of laptops","Just wanted to put in my opinion about this laptop.  I came from an Asus ROG G53, which I was very happy with, but it has been with me for 3 years or so, so I was looking for an upgrade.  Naturally, I looked into the new Asus ROGs, but also considered the Alienware laptops, Alienware SFF desktops, Asus SFF desktops, and some of the new 4K laptops (Lenovo and Acer).  My wife has an Acer laptop which is very nice, so I seriously looked into the Acer 4k laptop.  After looking closely at these alternatives, I soon gave up on a 4k laptop, mainly due to the performance issues I have seen in several detailed reviews, and I seems to me that the benefits of having a razor sharp screen are not worth it for my purposes.  It also occurred to me that a &#34;retina&#34; resolution screen works well on a tablet since it's usually closer to your eye (where it's some benefit), but on a laptop the screen with is usually farther away, so perhaps the super-resolution is not as beneficial - again my opinion.  I considered trying an SFF desktop, since I mainly use my laptop as a desktop replacement, but after looking at some configurations of the desktops, I found this Asus G751JL to actually be a better value.  I think that has to do with the higher overall demand for laptops, or maybe something else in the marketplace dynamics.  So I came down to the Alienware and Asus.  In the end, it came down to how happy I was with my current Asus, and their superior cooling system, which for me was a very large component.  I hate it when laptops gets really hot, and the fans become really noisy under load.  Some of the reviews for the Alienwares showed they get hot under load, but ALL of the reviews I found on the Asus show it's cooling is excellent for a laptop.  So I went with the Asus.  And how it is?  In a word, AMAZING.  Fantastic Screen: 17 inches of pure beauty.  My old Asus had a shiny 15inch 1080p TN panel, but this one is 17 inches, IPS, and is a MATTE finish.  The overall effect is a screen that simply &#34;glows&#34; and oozes quality.  I sat in a Starbucks yesterday with my back to a huge wall of windows, and was able to work with no trouble at all.  Screen hinge was a little stiff in the beginning, but has broken in over the past few days, and now can be opened without holding the base down.  This also happened with my old Asus.  Keyboard: amazing upgrade.  The old Asus keyboard was spongy and the keyboard sank a little with every keystroke.  The new one is ROCK SOLID, no movement or play at all, solid feeling, EXCELLENT feel.  The only thing I don't like is it's red backlight, which is a bit dimmer to me (I am red-green colorblind).  The old Asus required you to remove the keyboard to get into the laptop, but the new G751 has an easy-to-remove panel on the bottom, so the keyboard is much more solidly locked in.  Trackpad: much larger, good sensitivity, and MUCH BETTER BUTTONS.  It has 2 physical buttons, which are awesome, easy to push.  Graphics card: I don't use my computer much for games.  I know it's weird buying a gaming laptop if I'm not playing games on it.  I like the option of playing games on it, but I'm mainly a console gamer, since I like to be in the living room playing.  It's got a nice graphics card.  For a little more money, the G751JT and G751JY have more capable graphics, but at additional cost.  For me, this graphics card was plenty good enough, but instead I used the $200 money I saved to add the 500GB SSD, which is much more worth it to me.  I will say this graphics card has enough juice to drive a 4k monitor in the future, so that was important to me.  It's also got a DisplayPort plug, so it should be able to drive a 4k monitor without trouble.  Wifi: nice internet card and is the new AC type.  My old Asus had a very marginal wifi card, which I needed to upgrade.  The downside of the G751 wifi is that I don't think it's upgradeable.  The G751 wifi internet is fast and works well.  I tested it and I was getting 30 Mbps, which is the fastest I have on my internet service.  I used in a Starbucks, and no trouble connecting, and was also superfast.  Sound: only 1 speaker that I can see, on the bottom and on the left side.  It sounds pretty good for a laptop speaker, but it's only on one side, which is a bit disappointing.  Design and maintenance: As I said, there's a panel on the bottom, which you can remove with ONE SCREW, and you have access to 2 memory slots and both hard-drive bays.  MUCH MUCH BETTER.  I added a Samsung EVO 850 500GB SSD, and now the thing FLIES.  Very quick boot up and response, traditional HD for larger files, can't beat it.  The bad thing is there are 4 memory DIMM slots on this laptop, which is great.  Two of them are accessible through this panel, the other two require dis-assembly to access.  Unfortunately, Asus decided to use the 2 ACCESSIBLE memory slots to install the 2x8GB DIMMs, which doesn't make any sense to me at all.  I imagine the 2 unused memory slots sitting inside the laptop, and this irritates me.  I probably won't upgrade memory any more, but it would be nice to have the option.  The power plug has a 90-degree built-in, so it plugs in and runs back, which is really nice and doesn't get in the way.  Also, the power plug now has a ridge on it, so it stays in the laptop better.  It is a  traditional plug, though, not one of the those fancy magnetic plugs.  All 4 USB ports at 3.0, which is awesome.  One design improvement - they moved the USB ports on the left side towards the back, so they do NOT interfere with the DVD drive bay, which is very nice for me.  I like to plug in my mouse to the left side of the laptop so the cable doesn't interfere with my mouse with I place on the right side.  On my old Asus, I was always bumping into my mouse's USB plug.  Now it's nicely out of the way.  Kudos Asus for a nice design improvement.  Overall design is much more classy.  I swear it's a tiny bit thinner than my old Asus, or it's just the same thickness butlooks thinner because the screen's bigger.  Reinstalling windows: this was a pain.  The Asus Backtracker software process didn't work (I only had a USB 2.0 thumb drive, which I read it has trouble with and only works reliably with a 3.0 drive).  I tried Samsung cloning, which didn't work well either (Windows crashed when I removed the original HDD after cloning).  In the end I did a clean windows 8.1 install which went well with automatic activation via the code in the BIOS, once I found the right version of windows. I downloaded the drivers on the Asus website, and it works just fine.  There were no issues with the standard default windows drivers, but I updated them all anyway.  NOTE: There's a link out there to build Windows 8.1 install media, and you have to choose the regular &#34;Windows 8.1&#34; version to build onto a DVD or USB thumb drive.  I burned it onto a DVD so could keep it for the future.  Do NOT build the windows restore media using 8.1N, 8.1 Pro, 8.1 Pro N, or 8.1 Single Language (thanks Microsoft for the insanely confusing options).  If you do the wrong version, it will ask you for the authentication key.  If you use the right one, it proceeds automatically because it found the right key in the BIOS.  In all, I've very very happy with this machine.  Everything's upgraded, and has an air of class now with the new design.  One additional note: it's only a little bigger than my old Asus, which had a 15-inch screen.  That Asus came with an official ROG laptop bookbag, which is regrettably missing from this package, but I'm happy to report the old backpack does fit the G751, which is another bonus to me.  Highly recommended!","31"

The first thing I did since it didn't come with an SSD was to install one, I bought the Samsung EVO 850, used a USB interface and software to copy the O/S on the drive this came with to the SSD, opened up the bottom of the laptop, swapped the drives and off I went. Boot time from the SSD from hitting the power button to login screen is about 8 seconds. Just incredible speed.<br /><br />The design on the laptop, the cooling, is fantastic, the vents intake and exhaust out the back instead of the intake on the bottom and exhaust out the side or back like my old Dell did and it would overheat, this thing just runs so cool.<br /><br />As far as gaming, Ive turned up the graphics to ultra on all the games ive played lately, Dragon Age Inquisition, Battlefield 4, GTA V the list goes on and this thing crushes it well at 1080P.<br /><br />Only gripe is the same alotta other people said, it takes some getting used to where the ESC key and the Steam key is.

"B00TB8X8GA","Razer Blade RZ09-01301E22-R3U1 14-Inch Gaming Laptop","5","2015-07-04","This is a Generic Headline.  The Laptop Itself is Anything But Generic.","I am very, very happy with this Razer Blade laptop.  Quite pleased, indeed!  I'm no &#34;techie&#34;, nor a computer connoisseur; just an average internet surfer and video gaming enthusiast.  My old computers (a 2009 high-end laptop and a mid-grade 2011 desktop) had begun to frustrate me with their outdated performance, and I began to look for something that would replace both of them.  There were several features I kept in mind as I began to browse online for new computers:  - Portability, as I travel at least 200 miles each week - Plenty of RAM, to help ensure better performance and a longer lifespan - A good graphics card, one that wouldn't likely be listed in the &#34;minimum requirements&#34; of game releases for years - Solid construction, because I like to avoid using super glue and duct tape on things I own - A touchscreen, so I can perhaps &#34;draw&#34; directly on the screen without using a USB pen + tablet combo for art  ...And I think that was all.  I didn't think I was asking for very much, but maybe I was: poking around on the internet didn't yield quite as many results as I'd initially expected.  I picked the Razer Blade from a rather narrow field of candidates, keeping my fingers crossed in hopes that the price tag was worth it.  My expectations were met, and greatly surpassed.  This thing is a total beast.  It's very fast, the display is gorgeous, and it has a great feel to it.  As I stated at the start of this review:  I am very, very happy with this Razer Blade laptop.  Quite pleased, indeed!  Yes, it can get rather hot when it's pushed to its limits.  Its limits are pretty far out there, though; it's not going to burn a hole in your pants just because you opened Notepad while watching some Nickelback video on YouTube.  If you play recent triple-A games with the graphical settings maxed out super-duper-ultra style, yes -- it'll heat up.  So you probably don't want to douse yourself with lighter fluid and play The Witcher 3 with NVIDIA HairWorks on.  DON'T.  Yes, the cooling fans can get a bit loud -- but once again, this means you're putting a rather heavy load on the Razer Blade.  You're running AutoCAD, Photoshop, and Far Cry 4 on ultra settings all at the same time -- with Notepad open, too.  ...Yes, I am exaggerating -- but still, you aren't likely to hear anything but a whisper from the fans unless you're giving the Blade a strong push.  No bloatware to bolster your pushes, either; thanks, Razer!!  I do wish the trackpad buttons were a bit bigger, but that's a minor complaint.  They are at least responsive, as is everything else on the computer.  So, to summarize:  Five stars.  Worth every penny.  C'est magnifique!  Don't soak your clothes in paint thinner before playing games on this.  (If you do, don't wear them.)  And just to clarify:  I've had this computer for about 5 weeks, and have used it every day.  Also, have not had any of the WiFi problems someone else had mentioned in another review.","9"

It definitely has a yellow cast.  I tried adjusting the Asus Splendid app and I even used the built-in Windows color calibration.  When I compare the same image on the laptop to my desktop, it definitely has a yellow cast regardless of the display calibration.  I would NEVER recommend this laptop for critical image editing.  One other issue with the display is 'screen memory'.  I had the Windows Explorer on the screen for about 30 min.  When I closed it, there was a definite outline left.  Indicative of really cheap LCD display.  My 7 year old HP laptop had a better display.  I'm even more disappointed in the BIOS for a laptop manufactured on a few month ago!  Yes, it is EFI 'compliant', but it is NOT a graphical UEFI BIOS.  For something aimed at 'gamers',  the BIOS has nothing for overclocking. However, Asus does include a custom version of the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  There is no way to access the i7's Intel HD Graphics 4600 at all in the BIOS.  I have a video editor that can take advantage of GPGPU acceleration.  Can't do it with this laptop as there is no way to have the HD4600 and the nVidia GTX965M active at the same time.  I bought this version to save some money on SSD.  I purchased Samsung EVO 500GB SSD to install myself.  What a nightmare!  The way this laptop boots isn't like anything I've ever used.  I was trying to preserve the Recovery partition, but in the end, decided it wasn't worth it since I'll be upgrading to Win10 anyway.  I was a bit surprised when I contact Asus Tech support on how to clone the 1TB to the 500GB SSD.  &#34;Generally speaking, to ensure the compatibility and stability of the whole system, such operation isn't recommended.But if you insist to do it, I would suggest you to use the Asus Backtracker utility to backup the OS on a flash drive, and then load it back on the new SSD installed for a try.&#34;  Asus Backtracker didn't work at allbecause it requires the same size hard drive to restore the image.  Also there is no app to create a backup set of Recovery DVDs!  I had to contact Asus support on how to backup the Recovery partition.  The only way is to use the built in Windows back up.  Had not seen this before, but it did work.  If I had know all these issues beforehand, I would not have purchased, but I will still keep the laptop because it's fast.  I use a laptop mostly for internet stuff and might do some family video editing.  Certainly, nothing that need color correction. ------- 10 Aug 2015 -  Update to Win10 doesn't work.  Also noticed that this laptop doesn't have Win 8.1 PRO!  Seriously Asus? 11 Aug 2015 - Don't use Asus Back Tracker!  It just wiped out BOTH hard drives and I just lost all my disc image backups from Acronis. To make it worse, the new 16gb thumb drive that Backtracker was on get corrupt.  So now I have an laptop with NO OS.  Downgraded to two stars --   The laptop hardware is really great, but I feel that Asus has made some bad decisions for a laptop in this price range.  First No Win 8.1 PRO;  Second the Windows serial number is no where to be found. Not on the box, not on the manual or on a label on the bottom of the laptop.; Third, I don't like the how I had to make a back up.  It defaults to 16gb thumb drive which I went out an bought a new one, but it didn't seem to verify the integrity for that drive so I ended up with a corrupt thumb drive.

It may not be for everyone but if you are a gamer and want outstanding performance then I guarantee that you will find this laptop to be amazing. It has good and bad reviews and I think one of the bad reviews that I hear all the time about this laptop is that it has speakers that doesn't perform the best. I disagree with that and I found that these speakers that are on the laptop are awesome. They might not be equipped with surround sound but they are loud and sound really nice. And they are definitely better than the ones on my old HP laptop. I do not know how other gaming laptops sound but this one has great sound. Don't let the reviews that say the sound isn't the best stop you from buying this laptop. I also love the looks of this laptop. I think it looks sexy and the vents on the back of this laptop, not only look amazing, they also keep the heat away from the laptop and all of its components. The screen is bright and very easy on the eye. When I am outside, the brightness allows me to see the screen and its contents clearly with no problem. I love this laptop but I wouldn't recommend his laptop for everyone. It is big and heavy but if you can over come that, then this laptop is perfect for you.","1"

If you want a really high end gaming laptop with the latest gpu then you will be spending a thousand or two more depending on how high end you go and then you will have a really thick laptop that is a heat monster.  Then again if you buy a nice $1,000 laptop and try and run games on it you will get too much lag.  Anyway I decided on this and it is awesome.<br /><br />I am not going into all the details but there is one IMPORTANT thing I wanted to mention.  If you read the specs of the laptop on Amazon you will realize the specs describe last years model, but if you tried to order the current Omen of the HP website and get the 16 gigs of Ram and the 512 gig hard drive with the faster cpu and new gpu it will cost you about $300 to $400 more than this model.  I was hopping that since HP doesn't seem to make last years model that if I ordered this I might actually get this years model (and not last years stock that was sitting in the back of someones store) with the 960gpu and the faster i7 processor, but I was prepared to get the 860gpu with the slightly slower processor.  To my happy surprise this is the new model with the 960 gpu and the faster processor.  Obviously since the description has the older gpu and processor if you order you might get an older one, but if that is what was holding you back and pushing you to order directly from HP I would order this one on Amazon and save the $300 to $400 bucks.  The model number is L3Y55AV#ABA which translate to HP OMEN Notebook - 15t-5100.","8"

So far those are the only games I've tested, but I'm confident every game I throw at it will follow suit.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not completely happy with are the speakers. But that is really just a minor annoyance. It's totally worth it for everything else you get.<br /><br />I actually really like the keyboard and trackpad.

You could upgrade the regular hard drive to SSD if you want. Amazon has Samsung SSD with great warranty period at a reasonable price. The processor and picture quality of the screen are the best parts of the laptop. 16 GB RAM is more than sufficient to handle multiple applications and big data computation.<br /><br />The keyboard is soft and comfortable enough to type everyday. I can type for an hour without rest since I am a touch typist.<br /><br />However the only con is the back surface of the laptop could easily got finger print when you touch it.

So far it has been a great machine and has performed exactly as advertised. I've played BF4 and Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor both on Ultra settings and this computer can play both with next to zero lag. However you should use it's super cooling fan while doing so to avoid overheating, but this generates quite more noise than the idle fan. It comes equipped with Windows 8 which is a drag but you can upgrade to Windows 10 for free starting in August of 2015. Something that took me completely by surprise in a good way was the fact that I got a free copy of Batman: Arkham Knight from NVIDA. Finally the led keyboard is very rad and being able to mess with the colors is even more fun than you might expect. The pros definitely outweigh the cons, however there are lots of little things that can be annoying.<br /><br />Pros: great screen resolution, great graphics and fast load times, cool led keypad, free game, plenty of storage, fair price, not very heavy or super big, plenty of USB and other ports on the sides of the computer, a disc reader, cool look on the outside and inside, MSI Warranty with purchase.<br /><br />Cons: The clicker on the trackpad is very loud, the outside aluminum brush is very cool looking but an absolute fingerprint magnet, the super fan can be loud but this is understandable and you can't hear it with headphones in or the volume at halfway, not a great battery life (about 3 hours).<br /><br />Overall a great buy if you're looking for a great entry level gaming laptop that won't break your wallet or break at all.","1"

"B00T7EXKLG","ASUS G751JL 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","5","2015-07-29","Couldn't Ask For A Better Machine For The Price","I think reviews from verified purchasers are one of the best ways to find the best product in a competitive market. I appreciate many of the reviews I read for this laptop, but I still felt like I was taking a risk by investing so much money on a laptop without trying it out beforehand (in person). I felt the need to write my own review and make it as in depth as I thought fit. Please, comment on the review with any questions you may have. A laptop is a major investment and you shouldn't make the decision to purchase with any unanswered questions in mind. I will update this review frequently so new potential buyers can have the most up to date information/opinion regarding the G751JL-DS71. The * (3 of them about the same thing) in the review signifies a disclaimer which is discussed at the end.<br /><br /> I needed a new laptop for college, and it was between this beauty and the Lenovo Y70. Both met my budget of $1200 and my hardware requirements (minus having an SSD for the Asus one*). My college required the i7 processor and 16 gigs of RAM and 1 TB of HDD for engineering/lab programs/softwares, etc. I chose Asus because of their no questions asked warranty (unless you make internal modifications*) and the reviews for this laptop were just flat out better. Also Asus leads the laptop industry in cooling technology, and Lenovos are known to overheat just like Alienware. This Asus also had a better graphics card than the Y70 ( Lenovo had 860m). I can confidently tell you that I have made the correct decision to invest in Asus. Although I am not able to compare personal user experience side by side with the Y70, my review will highlight only this laptop. I hope the Lenovo Y70 reviews are also in depth. I have not looked at that webpage in about 4-5 weeks, but the link at the specific page is &#34; http://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-17-3-Inch-Touchscreen-Gaming-80DU0034US/dp/B00MCJQ6JG/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1438126231&sr=1-3&keywords=lenovo+y70 &#34; . One thing the Y70 had over the Asus was the 256 gig SSD. But, it also had a touchscreen which is a deal-breaker for me. I didn't want a smudgy screen that i had to constantly clean. Without further adieu, here's my review on the G751JL-DS71.<br /><br />I'm not a hardcore gamer, however this rig will work for the most graphic intensive games for at least 'high' settings. If you want to play Witcher 3 on max graphics, you can't find a laptop in this price range that will do that. Don't be unrealistic. The games I play are exclusively from Blizzard Entertainment: WoW (World of Warcraft), HOTS (Heroes of The Storm), and Hearthstone (I do plan on playing more games though because the experience of gaming on this rig is breathtaking. I upgraded from a 2006 dell inspiron desktop and all the games I played were on the lowest settings but now they can be maxed). WoW is the most graphic intensive of the 3 games, and in my garrison I get 45 fps on ultra settings (when the charger is in.. if unplugged graphics are noticeably worse). I put my graphics on high for raiding, and get 75 fps in 25 man raiding. For HOTS, graphics are maxed out on 'extreme', and I get no lag and high a high fps rate (don't know how to measure fps on HOTS, but no latency or lag at all)... and the same goes for Hearthstone. In the 2 weeks I've had this baby, I've never heard the fans make a single noise. The keyboard is never hot (or Warm .. it's always 'cool') and the backlit keys makes playing at night so much easier. I don't put this baby on my lap, but after 5 hours of straight gaming (HOTS on 'extreme') I felt the bottom of the laptop and there was only one slightly warm spot but I don't plan to game for more than 5 hours straight... so I'll be fine. The vents (yes, there are two! Asus does it best) are on the back of the laptop, so you could use it on your lap without a problem.<br /><br />As for the rest of the laptop (besides graphics card), the screen itself is gorgeous. The IPS FHD screen was totally worth the investment. Very bright and vivid, although I have not played any movies via the CD. I do watch Amazon Prime Video and I get no lag or buffering at all. Same goes for full HD videos on Youtube. This is thanks to the Beastly processor and the 16 gigs of ram. Also, I watch Amazon video on my lap (the laptop is on my lap) and with friends/family on each side, and there is no bad angle to view the screen from. Simple browsing on the web (Internet explorer is default, but I downloaded Chrome) is lightning fast despite my Verizon Fios internet speeds being 50 mbps. Once again, thank you processor and RAM. For its size (17.3&#34; screen), the laptop is more slim then what I imagined, and it weighs 8.6 pounds (the description on this page is wrong). It's not that heavy really, just imagine holding a flat gallon of milk with two hands. Like mentioned, the keyboard never gets hot, even in the middle of gaming. It is the best keyboard I've used to date. The keys still have that tacky sound, which I love, and the tactile pressure for typing is enough so that you don't type extra letters by dragging your fingers over it. An added bonus is the full number pad on the right side. If you are really into gaming, there are specific buttons for macro commands (3 different macro buttons), launching steam, accessing the ROG page, and even a button that lets you record your game (at the push of a button). The only qualm I have about the record button is that it is in the top left corner of the keyboard, where the esc key is on traditional keyboards, so sometimes I press the record button while trying to access the game menu (esc). Like I said the Backlighting is perfect; not too aggressive but bright to play in the dark. This keyboard is probably my favorite thing about this laptop. No wonder why my review is so long, I love to type with it! This keyboard will help bang out college essays and papers super quickly.<br /><br />This laptop has some drawbacks, however they aren't bigenough to drop this from 5 stars. Windows 8, as we all know, is terrible. This is solved by the free Windows 10 upgrade, and I will update this review after I've experienced the new OS. There are a lot of stupid pre-installed apps and programs (bloatware) on the laptop that took some considerable time to uninstall. A free Macafee trial comes with the purchase but Macafee sucks, so I'll be getting either Norton or 'Avast!' since they are user friendly, cheap, and most of all work. If you're on the go and forget to bring a charger with you, this laptop will only run for maybe 2-3 hours at most if you plan to use 100% power. I unplugged my laptop at 100%and then started writing this review with all settings on max (brightness, backlight display, etc.). It's at 45% right now and that's after 80 minutes.To solve the battery life problem, drop the graphics on games, dim the screen, and if you don't need internet, turn on airplane mode.<br /><br />The trackpad on the laptop has been a non factor for me because I purchased a wireless mouse at the same time I bought the laptop. I have never used the pad for more than 5 minutes. Also I don't use the laptop on my lap. I've been playing with it in preparation for this review and its not too bad, but everyday users have said its too sensitive or doesn't work well. Oh well, there isn't much more to say here, I'm not the one to ask about the pad.<br /><br />One category that hasn't been discussed much in these reviews is audio. The laptop has speakers and a subwoofer for that 'oomph' on bass. I'm not one of those people that need the immersive surround sound crystal clear audio to make further enhance the experience. This rig has a decent audio system. It can get loud but bass lacks for the most part, despite the subwoofer. Like I said, I don't consider this a drawback, since it is an upgrade over my old desktop speakers. If you're really that concerned, just buy a good pair of headphones and you won't have to worry about anything. I use headphones although I don't care about sound quality that much, and its fine. When I am watching Amazon video with others, like I said, the Audio is good enough to get the job done.<br /><br />Let's review the review..<br /><br />Pros- graphics (screen), gaming (cooling technology), KEYBOARD, fast web surfing, processo, second available drive bay* (unmentioned)<br />Cons- Bloatware, Macafee, WINDOWS 8, Escape key / Record key on keyboard, Battery life<br />Neutral- Audio system, Trackpad<br /><br />In conclusion, BUY THIS THING. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!! Best Value for the Price!<br /><br />If you've made it this far in the review, thank you for reading, you have the same research thoroughness as I do. PLEASE be honest on if this review helped you or not in your quest for a new laptop. This is my first Amazon review and I want your feedback on things you liked or things I can improve on. Also, PLEASE comment your questions, if any. I'm on Amazon everyday so I can answer them quickly!<br /><br />* I know one of the reasons I bought Asus was for the warranty, but I have now decided to install a 500gb SSD in the second available drive. I will update the review to say how the installation goes and how it perfects performance / my experience. I'm also considering upgrading the RAM to 32 gigs. That RAM change would require taking some of the insides apart to get to the 2 extra slots for ram. The SSD, however is accessible without taking anything apart. I called Asus and they said any internal modifications would void my warranty.","160"

That being that there was a screw lose in the packaging and I only noticed it since the rubber piece that covered the screw holes was also lose in the packaging.  Easy enough to replace but there was also something loose inside the laptop which sounded like a screw or a broken capacitor.  Amazon though was quick to allow me to return it and they over-nighted me another machine, one which I have to say looks great and no missing pieces.  Time will tell how the adapter plug will hold up, it doesnt look like its the best built item I've ever seen but I bought the Square Trade warranty which to me serves as a piece of mind.  I cannot afford a new laptop but maybe every 5 years and want that piece of mind that if something goes wrong i will only be without a laptop for a short period of time.  Im very happy with this machine and have been with the previous two.","6"

The specs for this laptop were much better than any Mac that was available for the same price. It load very very fast. I would say it loads within 10 seconds easily. I made the mistake of not calibrating my colors properly (hopefully you wont do the same). So when I edited some pictures, I needed to check some of them on my home computer, as the colors were over saturated. If you plan on purchasing this for photo editing, make sure you purchase or use a color calibration tool as well. The raw power of this machine is good enough to do any job. One final issue however..... If you are using this for photo editing in lightroom, make sure you turn off the function to allow GPU acceleration. When I left it on, it kept freezing up the computer. the screen would go black and it wouldn't move for a second or two. After turning that feature off however, it has since stopped. All in all. this is a pretty good machine. I don't plan on playing games on it, so I don't know how well it will be for that.","0"

Cons:   • I was shorted memory.  Advertised as SSD: 1000 GB.  But I got 931 GB.  Advertised as Hard drive: 2.0 TB.  But I got 1.81 TB.  I still got a  lot, but that is a significant shortage in my opinion.   • The touch pad is somewhat difficult to use.  While working with an application suddenly I find that I am decreasing or increasing the size of   my desktop icons without trying to.  Or it increases or decreases the size of the application I am working with.  And oddly, while using the   keyboard and typing on the web, it sometimes jumps to an open Word document without my will.  I think that happens because my palm   inadvertently touches the touch pad.  I use a mouse, which mitigates this headache.   • The sound is difficult to figure out.  I turned on the laptop one day to find there was no sound. After a lot of trouble shooting, I turned on my   game and found that my sound was coming from my television hooked up to my laptop, but not through the laptop.  Crazy yet, some sounds   came through the laptop, such as notification sounds.  Sound should always come through both the laptop (unless I choose to mute it) and the television.  I haven't been able to figure out how to do that.   • Finally, not so much a complaint, but I was disappointed that this laptop is missing a feature that another laptop that I returned had.  There was a button on that gaming laptop that kicked in a big internal fan.  I thought that was a cool feature, no pun intended.  Since this is a gaming   laptop, I was expecting it to have the same feature, but it doesn't.  However, I have not seen it get hot at all and I played a few games.  I don't own any high end graphics game yet.  I read another review that said this laptop does handle high end graphics without getting hot at all.  I don't hear any fans turning.  It is very quiet. Those are my cons.  The worse of them in my opinion is the memory shortage.  I should receive what they advertised that I was getting. The pros:   • Everything else is a pro.  It is very fast.  Windows 10 installed with no problems.  I had to uninstall and reinstall my graphics program because the update was failing, but that is fine now.  It is the best laptop out there for the price, power, and memory (though I was shorted).","2"
"B00T7XRGGC","ASUS K501UX 15-inch Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7 Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Hard Drive, Windows 10 (64 bit)), Black/Silver Metal","4","2015-08-23","Great Budget Laptop For Gaming","For the price, it's hard to beat as a budget gaming laptop. I've had it for over a week now and upgraded to Windows 10, and with the SSD it takes literally 2 seconds to boot. The IPS screen has good viewing angles, and of course has decent image quality. One thing that I have heard and now experienced is the amount of fingerprints this laptop attracts. If you want to keep it in perfect conditions you will have to clean it regularly, but I honestly don't mind it too much. The laptop does get a little warm when playing games, but that is to be expected for any gaming laptop, and this one actually manages to keep the main wasd and palm rest areas cool enough that it isn't bothersome.The hot air gets dispersed out the left side of the laptop, which is great instead of having it on the bottom. I have considered getting a cooling pad, but so far it seems to be doing just fine without one. I recommend this laptop for a gamer that wants a portable gaming laptop on a budget. Anything less than $1,000 would be sacrificing a lot more core elements, so this one easily takes the cake.","1"

It even shut down several times recently due to overheating. I did quite a lot of searching on the topic, and saw this laptop cooler in a YouTube demo review. Read the reviews here on Amazon and decided it was the right thing for me to try. It has solved the problem completely. I had previously kept my laptop on a cooling pad, but it did not have any fans in it, and I had also sometimes blocked the airflow on one side with papers, etc. Now my laptop stays cool even after hours and hours of heavy use and tasks that use a lot of energy which would have caused it to overheat before. I can feel the underside of it, as well as the top all over the keyboard, and it is not even warm, but just room temperature. The only heat is mildly warm air coming from the vent next to the hard drive. The blue lights are rather nice, and can't really be seen too much if your laptop takes up the width of the cooler and you have it toward the front. I like being able to plug it in and forget about it, so it just goes on when the computer starts up, and it has an extra port, so no loss of one for other things. Compared to the cost of repairs, or the hassle of sending my computer off to the manufacturer to investigate the overheating problem, this was well worth my money!!! I will never be without it again.","9"
"B00OBQ5950","ASUS G751JT 17-Inch Gaming Laptop [2014 model]","1","2015-08-28","Horrible, nothing but trouble","This has to be the worst computer I have ever had. I own a photography business and needed a computer with good graphics and a fast processor so I could edit my images correctly and efficiently. My laptops never seem to be fast enough or have enough memory, so I decided to spend more and thought a gaming laptop would be the way to go. I've always had PCs, so I decided to stick with a PC instead of paying a bit more for a Mac. Boy was that a mistake! This computer has given me nothing but trouble. I purchased it in December of last year, and in February it completely crashed and I couldn't get it to boot back up. I called Asus customer service and they told me to remove the battery pack and put it back in (newsflash - there is no removable battery pack). The customer service was horrible and they said it would take over 2 weeks for them to look at it and see if they could repair it under warranty. So, I took it to a local repair shop and paid out of pocket to have it fixed. Turns out my SSD drive crashed and they were unable to recover anything (good thing I had everything backed up in the cloud). They said that SSD drives are touchy and if they are bad, they'll go in the first few months. So I guess I got one of the bad ones... They repaired it and I thought everything was fine. However, throughout these past 8 months, I have had the blue screen of death more often than I can count and I hold my breath every time I shut it down or restart it because I never know if it will work. This is, by far, the worst computer I have ever owned and the biggest waste of money. It's a laptop, but I can't move it because every time I do, something goes wrong internally. I spent more money on this than I've ever spent in the past and was hoping to get more than 2 years out of this. I'll be lucky if it makes it a full year! Guess I'll be looking into a Mac soon...","3"
